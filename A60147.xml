            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THERE are Three Things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially requiſite unto a <hi>Worthy Communicant;</hi> to believe and own the <hi>Truths,</hi> which our B. Lord would preſerve the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of by this Institution; and to have a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſe of the <hi>Comforts,</hi> and <hi>Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> that may ariſe from thence; and then to perform thoſe <hi>Duties</hi> of Love and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and faithful Obedience, which reſult from our Covenant Relation to him, and the open Profeſſion of it. The Doctrines, and the Encouragements, and the Duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity are admirably connected, and joyn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The Principal of all theſe we are called to conſider in this Sacred Ordinance. Which yet is ſhamefully neglected by many, who would take it very ill, not to be thought good Chriſtians: who live from year to year in the Omiſſion of it; who make no Conſcience of
<pb facs="tcp:44317:4"/> Remembring the Death of Chriſt in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. As if they had no Saviour who dyed for 'em; or he had not Appointed this way of Remembring his dying Love; Or as if the Command, <hi>Do this, in Remembrance of me,</hi> becauſe ſpoken to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> did only concern <hi>them,</hi> and the Miniſters of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church. Whereas tho' our Lord ſate down with the <hi>Twelve,</hi> the Command is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them <hi>as Diſciples,</hi> and Repreſentatives of all his Church, rather than <hi>as Apoſtles.</hi> Or if the latter, He gave it to them, to d ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe it afterwards unto Others: (not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their own Communicating; for they who deliver the Elements as Miniſters, do partake of 'em as Diſciples, and Chriſtians, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,) <hi>What I have received of the Lord, that alſo I deliver unto you,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: and if <hi>Miniſters</hi> are bound to <hi>Deliver</hi> it, the <hi>People</hi> are bound to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</hi> If our Saviour's words, <hi>Do this in Remembrance of me,</hi> relate to Miniſters <hi>as ſuch,</hi> it is a Command for them to Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Lord's Supper; and the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand muſt be ſuppoſed to bind the People to Receive it, that doth oblige Miniſters to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it.</p>
            <p>There be ſome who omit it from Superſtitious, unbecoming Fears, and Scruples, as if our Lord were more to be Honoured by our abſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his Table, than by frequenting of it.
<pb facs="tcp:44317:4"/> Many, on the other hand, are guilty of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and Raſhneſs, by careleſs, unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Approaching to it. Several Caſes are here ſpoken to, which relate to both ſorts, though many more ſhould be added.</p>
            <p>As to the manner of performing this Duty, we cannot come too humbly, in a ſenſe of our Ignorance, and Weakneſs, and Sinfulneſs; owning, that we are nothing, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and can do nothing, without his Grace, that may be pleaſing to him: and that we have done very much to diſhonour and provoke him, (eſpecially by our late Tranſgreſſions,) that we deſerve to be caſt out of his ſight, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Priviledges of his Houſe and Family, never to taſte of the <hi>Childrens Bread.</hi> But having renewed our Repentance, before we come, we are called to expreſs our Love, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and Joy. When we view a Dying Saviour, a <hi>Crucified Jeſus</hi> before our eyes, lifted up upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> drawing all Men to him, bowing down his Head, and ſtretching out his Arms to embrace us; as he appears all bloody to fright us from our ſins, ſo he opens his ſide, that we may ſee his Heart flaming with Love. He calls us to behold his wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed body, with Hearts wounded with a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Senſe of Sin, and a growing Love to the Redeemer. He calls us to ſeal a <hi>Covenant of Fidelity</hi> to him, and to accept the Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Benefits of a Gracious <hi>Covenant,</hi> ſealed back from him to us.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:44317:5"/>
            <p>Here we behold the Lamb of God a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for thoſe ſins, we have ſo lately Repented of; removing that Wrath which we ſo lately trembled at, as having justly deſerved; and therefore we ſhould Approach this Table with Gladneſs, and Rejoycing. Here we are called to give publick Expreſſions of the Love and Honour we bear to the Remembrance of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> We do it in Thankfulneſs to him, for all he hath done, and ſuffered for us. Here we profeſs our Faith, and Hope, and Truſt in a <hi>Crucified Saviour.</hi> We own him for our Lord, and our Jeſus; we declare we are not aſhamed of his <hi>Croſs,</hi> or of any Difficulties, Trials, or Sufferings we may be expoſed to, for his ſake.</p>
            <p>He needed not have cared whether we were Saved, or no: And yet how low hath he condeſcended to purchaſe our Happineſs and Salvation; and to Aſſure us of it? What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of love is this? that the Eternal Son of God, Incarnate, ſhould endure a Painful, Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious, curſed Death for us, that we might not dye Eternally? How wonderful and incomprehenſible is this love! How plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſhould be the contemplation of it! Here is an Abyſs of <hi>Love,</hi> of Adorable, Allmighty <hi>Love,</hi> (on this ſide Heaven, but leading to it,) which we cannot fathom, but are called to admire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Crucified Jeſus</hi> repreſented, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated,
<pb facs="tcp:44317:5"/> as a Sacrifice for us! What more Glorious Sight can we deſire to ſee? How ſhould this awaken all our Affections, and, in ſome reſpect, puzzle not only our Paſſions, but our Faith too? As an Object too large for our narrow Thoughts, too high for our Finite Minds, too Great for our Wonder, and for our little Love, and Joy. How delightful is it, to be thus even loſt in the conſideration of this matchleſs condeſcenſion, and Grace of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer? When the Object is too big for our higheſt Raptures, and Tranſports, and we are ſwallowed up in ſilence, and aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>How ſhould this <hi>Love</hi> conſtrain and draw forth ours? When we conſider for what vile and ſinful creatures the Son of God gave his life and made his Soul an Offering. How his <hi>Love</hi> to us Enemies and Rebels, was ſtronger than fear, or ſhame, or death, without bounds, and without example. When we Feaſt on this Sacrifice, what can we do leſs, in requital for this Infinite love, than devote our ſelves, Souls and Bodies to him, as the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of his Death? And lay all our Affairs, and deareſt concernments at his Feet to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of as he pleaſeth? How can it be, but our love to him muſt be kindled, maintained, and encreaſed by ſuch an Institution? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, and conſidering his love to us, till we are brought practically to conclude, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, that our love to him is too little, if we
<pb facs="tcp:44317:6"/> love any thing beſides him, except it be by his order, for his ſake, and to his Glory; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be according to the preſcribed Rules, and limits he hath ſet us.</p>
            <p>And how proper is it here to Renew our <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant?</hi> faithfully to promiſe to be entirely the Lord's, to be obedient and reſigned to him to be Treacherous to him no more, but ſtedfaſt and reſolved in his Service? taking his Law as our Rule, his will to be our will, to love what he loves, to hate what he hates, to have the ſame Friends and Enemies with our Bleſſed Lord. For here we put God in mind of his <hi>Covenant</hi> with us through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and our ſelves in mind of our <hi>Covenant</hi> with God. And upon renewed Repentance for any ſins we have committed, after any Inſtance of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithfulneſs to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Engagements, by unſuitable walking, we here implore his Mercy and Grace to pardon us. We declare at the ſame time, that we deſire to take hold of his <hi>Covenant,</hi> that tho we are Sinners, we are not <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> we confeſs our ſins, and beg Forgiveneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat our Reſolutions of Fidelity to him. We truſt in the unſhaken Faithfulneſs, and Truth of God to his gracious Promiſes: We place our hope and confidence in the ſtability of his <hi>Everlaſting Covenant,</hi> which the Blood of <hi>Jeſus, (the Blood of the Covenant)</hi> hath confirmed, and made <hi>Everlaſting:</hi> Not
<pb facs="tcp:44317:6"/> Truſting in our own Faith, but in his Free Mercy, and invariable Truth; not in our Repentance, but his Gracious Pardon; not in our own <hi>Preparations,</hi> but his Merciful <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance</hi> of us in his Beloved Son; not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing we our ſelves can do, but in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Fruits</hi> of his <hi>Death,</hi> and the <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of his <hi>Croſs,</hi> as diſpenſed and applied according to the rule, method, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the <hi>Goſpel-Promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is our <hi>Priviledge,</hi> and this our <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment</hi> at the Table of our <hi>Lord.</hi> And there is hardly any Subject will better bear to be treated of in ſeveral different methods, than this; or upon which, repeated <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> by ſeveral <hi>Perſons,</hi> may be more uſeful. I grant there are many Excellent Books already writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, to Inſtruct Men in the Nature, and to direct and aſſiſt their <hi>Devotion,</hi> in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of this <hi>Holy Sacrament.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign not to wreſt them out of their hands, into whoſe this may fall. I pretend not to add, but to urge and proſecute the ſame Great End; and ſometimes by the ſame Arguments and Expreſſions. I acknowledge my having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by the <hi>Writings</hi> of others; I hope 'tis what they deſign'd. Theſe <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to many, when <hi>Preacht,</hi> and being ſince reviewed (ſome of them with ſome Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) I hope they may be of uſe, at leaſt to thoſe who heard 'em, and deſired their <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:44317:7"/> And it muſt be granted, that what is of ſo <hi>Univerſal,</hi> and <hi>Important a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,</hi> as a due <hi>Participation</hi> of this <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> ought to be Treated and Inculcated, in as many different ways, as may beſt ſuit the <hi>Various capacites</hi> of ſeveral <hi>Perſons.</hi> It may be, a ſhorter Account of <hi>the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper,</hi> with <hi>Meditations</hi> and <hi>Devotions</hi> adapted thereto, would be more proper for the <hi>Younger,</hi> and more <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Sort:</hi> this I have promiſed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, but have not yet had time to perfect. The <hi>Lord</hi> follow this, and all Endeavours, for the Furtherance of <hi>Real Godlineſs,</hi> with an Abundant Bleſſing.</p>

            <p>THROUGH the Merciful For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of God, we now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin another Year; and have outlived ſeveral, who, a twelve month ago, were as like to have ſeen <hi>this New years-day,</hi> as any of us. That we may begin it with ſome Serious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions, ſuitable to <hi>the beginning of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44317:10"/> Year,</hi> and the approaching Solemnity of <hi>the Lord's Supper,</hi> I have choſen theſe words, as proper unto <hi>both.</hi> They are brought in, as one Inference among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, from <hi>the conſtraining Love of Chriſt,</hi> which the Apoſtle had mentioned in the 14th <hi>Verſe.</hi> Many uſeful things might be obſerved, in explaining the Context, and ſhewing the Connexion of this, with the preceding Verſes. But I ſhall at preſent conſider them more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, and in the General.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any Man be in Chriſt, he is a New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> or, <hi>Let him be</hi> a New Creature. He ought to be ſo. The Original will bear either ſenſe; The words may be taken <hi>imperatively,</hi> or <hi>affirmatively:</hi> For we find not <hi>Is</hi> in the Original. It is true, that <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in Christ, is a New Creature;</hi> And it is true, that he is obliged thereby to prove his Union to Chriſt, <hi>he ought to be a New Creature.</hi> Neither ſenſe is to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That <hi>the State</hi> of ſuch as are in Chriſt, and likewiſe <hi>their Obligation,</hi> may be comprehended. It is the <hi>Character,</hi> and <hi>Qualification</hi> of ſuch as are in Chriſt, and it is their <hi>Duty.</hi> So that we may conſider theſe words, either as a <hi>Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Aſſertion,</hi> That ſuch as are in Chriſt Jeſus, are always New Creatures: Or, as a <hi>Seaſonable Exhortation,</hi> That they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44317:10"/> ſhould manifeſt that they are <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> by diſcovering themſelves to be <hi>New Creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In both ſenſes <hi>the New Creature</hi> is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Conſequent of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to Chriſt.</hi> The connexion is inſeparable between theſe two. So that we may truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That <hi>all ſuch are ſo;</hi> And we may rationally exhort all, that pretend to ſuch a Priviledge, that they <hi>would be ſo,</hi> and ſhow it. But whether conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as a Doctrinal Propoſition, or as an Exhortation; whether conſider'd as a Command from God, or as a wiſh and Prayer of the Apoſtle; There are <hi>three things</hi> obvious enough to be explained, and ſpoken to. 1. Something concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Priviledge of <hi>being in Chriſt,</hi> and the import of it. 2. Concerning this <hi>New Creation,</hi> which is to be Connected with it. And, 3. Of the Connexion between them, and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon all that are <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> to be <hi>New Creatures;</hi> That <hi>if any Man be in Christ, he is, he muſt be a New Creature;</hi> or where there is no ſuch Change, it is in vain to pretend to be <hi>in Chriſt;</hi> Or he that is <hi>not a New Creature,</hi> he is <hi>not in Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> he hath no part in him, and ſhall have no benefit by him.</p>
            <p>Every Man's Title and Claim to a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44317:11"/> ſpecial <hi>Intereſt in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Relation to him,</hi> muſt be tryed by this Rule. This is more fully expreſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>But you have not ſo learned Chriſt, if ſo be you have been taught of him, as the Truth is in Jeſus, that ye put off concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer converſation, the old man, which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt according to the deceitful luſts: And be ye renewed in the ſpirit of your mind: And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in Righteouſneſs and true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt.</hi> Something it will be neceſſary to ſpeak concerning <hi>this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to Chriſt,</hi> from which we are ſaid to be <hi>in him,</hi> as ſometimes Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>in us.</hi> And both are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times joyned together, <hi>John</hi> 6.56. <hi>He that eateth my Fleſh and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are three ſorts of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> which we cannot ſufficiently admire. The firſt from all <hi>Eternity,</hi> in the <hi>impenetrable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets</hi> of <hi>inacceſſible Light.</hi> The ſecond, in the <hi>fulneſs of Time, in the Womb of the Virgin.</hi> The third is made daily by the <hi>Spirit and Grace of Christ.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe is the <hi>Eſſential <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> between the <hi>Eternal Father,</hi> and the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> in the <hi>Adorable Mystery</hi> of the <hi>ever bleſſed Trinity.</hi> The <hi>ſecond,</hi> is the <hi>Perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44317:11"/> of the Humane Nature with the Divine,</hi> in that <hi>unſpeakable Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The <hi>third,</hi> is the <hi>Spiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> between <hi>Chriſt and Chriſtians,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the two former, and hath ſome dark reſemblance of them. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, let me mention a few things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is a <hi>real <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Souls of Believers,</hi> how difficult ſoever it be to underſtand the manner of it. He is not only <hi>Emanuel, God with us,</hi> as partaker of Fleſh and Blood, having aſſumed our Nature; He is not only <hi>for us,</hi> in the <hi>Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> by giving himſelf to God a <hi>Ranſom</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for us: But he is ſaid <hi>to be in us,</hi> and to <hi>dwell in our hearts;</hi> and we are ſaid <hi>to be in him,</hi> and <hi>dwell in him,</hi> as the Branches are in the Vine, and by many other <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Idaea's</hi> of Union is this ſet forth by Alluſions and Metaphors, and Similitudes of many ſorts, to ſignifie and repreſent to us this bleſſed Union between Chriſt and real Chriſtians. And as he did partake with us of Fleſh and Blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2 14. We are ſaid <hi>to be made partakers of Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 14. as the Principle and Meaſure of all <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Polhill,</hi> Chriſtus in Corde, <hi>p.</hi> 10.12.</note>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44317:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> our Spiritual Enjoyments and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And <hi>to be in h m that is true in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, John</hi> 1.5.20.</p>
            <p>It is ſometimes ſet forth by the natural Union between Head &amp; Members: At o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, by the Marriage union; and both are diſcourſed of together. <hi>Eph</hi> 5.25.30. <hi>We are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones;</hi> By Alluſion to what is ſaid of <hi>Eve</hi> as to the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> He is ſet forth as a <hi>Foundation</hi> for never failing Support, as a <hi>Husband</hi> for the deareſt <hi>Love;</hi> as a <hi>Vine,</hi> as an <hi>Head,</hi> for Vital Influence; as <hi>Food,</hi> and Nouriſhment, for the moſt intimate Conjunction. He is ſaid <hi>to be one fleſh with us,</hi> and we are ſaid <hi>to be one ſpirit with him.</hi> Yea, as Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to be in the Father,</hi> Believers are ſaid <hi>to be in him,</hi> and <hi>he in them, John</hi> 14.20. Yea further, he is ſaid <hi>to be one with them; as he and the Father are one, John</hi> 17.21. And he is ſaid alſo <hi>to live in them,</hi> and they <hi>to live in him,</hi> Gal. 2.20. Inſomuch that ſometimes the Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> as of one Perſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. where <hi>the Church</hi> is called <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How amazing and admirable is the Expreſſion, <hi>Chriſt in us,</hi> and <hi>we in him!</hi> What <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> is there in this Myſtery! as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 27. Who ever heard before of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant's
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44317:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> being in his Maſter, or a Diſciple in his Lord, or the Members being in the Head? But here is a Myſtery of Divine Love and Grace, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſeems with ſome kind of Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſpeak of, at every turn, and upon every occaſion; to mention it ſeveral times in <hi>one Chapter,</hi> in <hi>one Verſe;</hi> yea and over and over <hi>in the ſame Verſe:</hi> So un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned and ſo fervent was his Love to Chriſt, if he fight or triumph, it is <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> If he bleſs God, or God bleſs him, it is ſtill ſpoken of <hi>as in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> He ſpeaks, as if he could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without him; His <hi>Life,</hi> his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> his very <hi>Being</hi> is <hi>to be in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt ſilently Adore this Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Divine Love,</hi> and cover our Faces in <hi>humble Adoration</hi> for ſuch an <hi>Honour,</hi> which the <hi>bleſſed Angels</hi> might envy, if they were capable of it: For however Chriſt be there Head, they are yet at his Feet, they are <hi>not in him,</hi> as Believers are. It is true, the <hi>Angels</hi> ſerve him, and worſhip in his preſence; they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him by Millions, they encompaſs his Throne with Flames of Love, they quit Heaven to obey his Orders, they flye ſwift as the Wind to execute his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; But <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not <hi>in them,</hi> as he is <hi>in us;</hi> nor they <hi>in him,</hi> as we are ſaid to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44317:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> be. The Name <hi>Emanuel,</hi> is to them an inexpreſſible Name; they cannot ſay, <hi>God with us,</hi> in the ſenſe that we can: For he took not the Nature of <hi>Angels</hi> at firſt, and he hath not taken them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch an union with himſelf, as he has the Sons of men. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That you may not miſtake, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that all Chriſtians are not in Chriſt <hi>in a like manner.</hi> Some are ſo on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and a <hi>viſible profeſſion,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by a <hi>living union.</hi> Such a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence our Saviour makes, <hi>John</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 6. where he tells us, there are ſome Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of a Tree that have only Influence enough to bring forth <hi>Leaves,</hi> and no <hi>Fruit</hi> and are <hi>caſt off as Branches,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; They ſeemed to be Branches in Chriſt, they appeared <hi>as Branches;</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt union to him, but were not what they ſeemed to be. In this ſenſe I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the <hi>being in Chriſt</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.22. <hi>I was known by face to the Churches that are in</hi> Judea, <hi>that are in Christ Jeſus:</hi> That is, to the Body of <hi>profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> there, as diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Jews,</hi> though there were many rotten Members amongſt them, that were not in Chriſt by a <hi>lively Faith.</hi> Therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The great <hi>Bonds of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion between Chriſt and real Christians,</hi> or <hi>true Believers;</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:44317:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> are, <hi>the Spirit on his part,</hi> and <hi>Faith, and Love on ours.</hi> On which account, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid <hi>to dwell in us by his Spirit,</hi> and we are ſaid <hi>to dwell in him by Faith.</hi> By the <hi>Spirit</hi> he comes down to us, by <hi>Faith</hi> we aſcend up to him. It is by <hi>Faith</hi> we are joyned to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as our <hi>Foundation,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.6. And by the <hi>Spirit</hi> we are <hi>built toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for an habitation of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2 <hi>v.</hi> 22. And, <hi>he that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit with him,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.17. Our Union unto Chriſt immediately ariſeth from the Communication of <hi>his Spirit</hi> to us; and our Participation of the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> with him, by which <hi>Spirit</hi> the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as the <hi>Image of Christ, is formed in us,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. And the Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>new ſpiritual form,</hi> gives deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Perſon. Chriſt enters into us by <hi>Faith</hi> and inhabits in us by his <hi>holy Spirit.</hi> And of theſe two Bonds, the <hi>Spirit</hi> is the <hi>primary one,</hi> as being the Author of the other. And therefore Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lievers are ſaid <hi>to live in the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> and to <hi>walk in the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and to be <hi>led by the Spirit.</hi> Hereby ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>We know that we dwel in him,</hi> and <hi>he in us becauſe he has give us of his Spirit,</hi> 1 John 4.13. 2 Corinth 13, 14.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Lord</hi> and the <hi>Soul!</hi> Who would not admire at their proud diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful Folly, that while they cannot explain the Union between <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> are ready to jeer at their juſt, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and modeſt Ignorance, who call this other, <hi>a Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion:</hi> Or, becauſe they know not what to make of it, would make <hi>nothing;</hi> and will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low there ſhould be any ſuch Thing at all, or would have it to be next to <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> But have thoſe words no ſenſe belonging to them, or not a Great Senſe? 1 Cor. 6.17. <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord, is one Spirit.</hi> This is a Myſtery, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that hath Riches of Glory in it,</hi> 1 Col. 27.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> is the <hi>Foundation of Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and Communion</hi> with him, as the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44317:15"/> Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 John 1.3. <hi>That he may have Fellowſhip with us, and truly our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That is, That you may have like Fellowſhip with God and Chriſt, as we have. Not that our U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Communion is <hi>firſt</hi> with <hi>the Church,</hi> and then with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as ſome of late have Argued; though therein they contradict a Learned Man, whoſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, in other Inſtances, they are very fond of; I mean <hi>Epiſcopius.</hi> For upon that place he ſays, <hi>That this ſenſe is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be avoided, That we are firſt united to the Apostles, and then to God and Chriſt.</hi> It is both abſurd in it ſelf, and of very ill conſequence. It is <hi>in it ſelf abſurd,</hi> becauſe <hi>we,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles</hi> themſelves are but <hi>Brethren,</hi> in reſpect of Union un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt; They are united to him in the ſame manner with us. And there are very ill conſequences would follow from that Opinion: For then there muſt be Union and Communion with ſome Men and Company of Men, before we can have Union and Communion with Chriſt, which Error, by degrees, was ſerviceable to introduce the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Let me add,</p>
            <p n="5">5. This Union is not to be ſuppoſed without <hi>Regeneration,</hi> without the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44317:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> of our corrupt Nature by the Spirit of Chriſt, in order to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him. The Union otherwiſe between Chriſt and us would be like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's</hi> Image, <hi>the Head of gold, and the Arms of ſilver, and the Feet of clay.</hi> If there be not Spiritual Life from Chriſt by the quickening Spirit, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt would be partly dead; And who would ever indure a dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be joined to him, though it were the Carkaſe of one he never ſo dearly loved?</p>
            <p n="6">6. This muſt alſo be remembred, That this Union between Chriſt and us, is to be brought about by <hi>mutual conſent,</hi> and therefore often ſet forth by the Conjugal Union, to which Conſent is neceſſary. Our Lord has laid the Foundation, and declared his readineſs to receive us into Union with him, by the publication of his Goſpel; And it is the work of his Spirit, to make us willing <hi>to yield our ſelves to the Lord,</hi> that we may enter into Union with him, and be brought under the Bond of the Covenant; We muſt know him, chuſe him, and accept him for our Teacher, Saviour, and Lord, by a preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with his Terms. We muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote and give up our ſelves heart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44317:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> and unfeignedly, and unreſervedly to be his; And then we may ſay, <hi>My Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved is mine,</hi> and <hi>I am his;</hi> I am <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and Chriſt <hi>in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here is the great Office and Work of <hi>Faith</hi> in this World, to bring Chriſt and our Souls into this bleſſed Union; Upon which Account we are <hi>now in him,</hi> as <hi>hereafter</hi> we ſhall be <hi>with him.</hi> When the work of Faith is over, and we are brought to Glory, we ſhall be <hi>with Chriſt,</hi> and ſhall be ever with the Lord; But <hi>now</hi> we are ſaid to be <hi>in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, we are now ſaid to <hi>ſit in Heavenly places in Christ Jeſus;</hi> But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after it is promiſed, <hi>we ſhall ſit down on his Throne with him.</hi> Now he dwells in us, and we in him; Hereafter we ſhall be with him, to behold his Glory. For ſo he Prays, <hi>John</hi> 17. And he promiſed the Penitent Thief, that he ſhould <hi>be with him that day in Paradiſe.</hi> Our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al life is now hid <hi>with God in Chriſt,</hi> as to preſent Union by Grace; but it is hid <hi>with Christ in God,</hi> as to eternal Glory. The expreſſions are obſervably diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; <hi>In Chriſt now, with Chriſt hereafter;</hi> Now united with God in Chriſt, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after with Chriſt in God; <hi>In Chriſt upon Earth, In God in Heaven.</hi> For to be in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44317:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> Chriſt, refers to the Mediator, and is by Faith; But Faith ſhall ceaſe in Heaven, and the Mediator deliver up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the Father, that God may be all in all. Thus for a brief Explication of the Priviledge of being in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">II Let us conſider what is affirmed of thoſe that are in Chriſt, or what they are exhorted to; <hi>What they are, if they be in Chriſt;</hi> What they muſt manifeſt themſelves to be, if they will prove an Intereſt in ſuch a Priviledge; that is, <hi>New Creatures.</hi> If any Man be in Chriſt, he is a New Creature; Or <hi>a New Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> for ſo the Original will bear. And it is not in this place only, but ſeveral others, where the like Expreſſions are uſed concerning that great Change, that is made by the Grace of God on the Souls of Men. It is termed <hi>a Creation,</hi> for the greatneſs of the Change; and <hi>a new Creation,</hi> for the Excellency of it.</p>
            <p>One may be apt to think, That the Extraordinary Converſion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> made ſo great a Change in him, that it is on that Account he ſo often ſpeaks in ſuch terms; that he mentions ſo often <hi>old things done away,</hi> and <hi>the old Adam put off;</hi> That he ſpeaks of <hi>a New Man, a New Creation,</hi> and <hi>New Creatures,</hi> and a Spiritual <hi>Reſurrection</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:44317:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> from the Dead, and the like; As that <hi>Glorious Light,</hi> which ſhone round about him, when he was ſtruck to the ground in the way to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> might occaſion him ſo often to uſe the expreſſion of <hi>Light;</hi> for, at every turn, he ſpeaks of <hi>the Father of Lights, the Armour of Light, the Kingdom of Light, the Inheritance of the Saints in Light, of Illumination, of opening the Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. But how fit a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this of the Change by converting Grace, as might be illuſtrated, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the ſtate of Spiritual Death, that we are in before, and by conſidering the nature of the Change it ſelf, and the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Operations that do afterwards manifeſt and diſcover it.</p>
            <p>We are created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, begotten again, born from above, quickened and made alive, who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral words are uſed, according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Powers of the Soul, and according to the different objects <hi>the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is converſant about: For as this Change diſcovers it ſelf in <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> it is a tranſlation from darkneſs into <hi>Marvelous Light,</hi> and brings us to the true and ſaving knowledge of God in Chriſt The f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rſt thing that God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Natural World, was <hi>Light,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:44317:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> 1 <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9, 10. As in <hi>the Will,</hi> it is a choice of God, and full purpoſe of heart to cleave to him. And as to the different objects it has alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther names; As referring to Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is <hi>Faith;</hi> To Chriſt living, it is <hi>Love;</hi> To Chriſt ruling and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is <hi>New Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here it is called <hi>a New Creation.</hi> Not as if it were a removal of the old Subſtance, or any of the Powers of the Soul; But a rectifying, a ſanctifying of them, by ſetting up a new light in the Underſtanding, giving a new Byas and Inclination to the Will, turning the Heart from Sin and the World, to God and Chriſt, to Holineſs and Heaven. Not changing the Nature of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but curing the Corruption and Diſorder of them, and changing the Objects about which they are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
            <p>Some think the Metaphor is taken from <hi>the Proſelytes</hi> to the Jewiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſe Converſion to Judaiſm was accounted a kind of <hi>New Birth,</hi> and they reckoned <hi>New Creatures.</hi> Which our Lord ſeems to allude to, in his Diſcourſe with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and wonders ſuch a Doctor in <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be ignorant of it. Others think it may allude to the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44317:18"/> Jewiſh Cuſtom, with reſpect to their <hi>children,</hi> They taught them to read at three years old, and then inſtructed them till five, then put them to School, where they learned the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> till Ten, and for three years more they applyed themſelves to underſtand the Jewiſh Traditions, and the Myſteries of the Synagogue; and when that time was expired, at the Age of Thirteen, they ſaid a Child was <hi>a New creature;</hi> that is, ſufficiently inſtructed how to live and pleaſe God, alledging <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.21. <hi>This People have I formed, or created for my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our ſtate of nature and ſin is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſt by the Metaphor<note place="bottom">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Hammond's Serm. <hi>on</hi> Gal. 6.15.</note> of <hi>Old Age,</hi> our natural Corrupt Affections, that are born and grow up with us, are called <hi>the Old Man;</hi> as if ſince <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall we were decrepit, and feeble, and Aged as ſoon as Born; as a Child begotten by a Man in a Conſumption, never comes to the ſtrength of a Man, is alway weak, and crazy, and puling, hath all the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, and Corporal Infirmities of Age: before he is out of his Infancy.

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:44317:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> and <hi>New Covenant, New Tongues,</hi> a <hi>New Commandment, New Man, Mark</hi> 1.27. <hi>Chap</hi> 16.17. <hi>John</hi> 13.34. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.15. and the ſtate of Grace expreſt by this, <hi>All things are become New.</hi> The Man, when old, hath entred a ſecond time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Mothers Womb, and is <hi>born again,</hi> and is become a glorious, beauteous <hi>New Creature,</hi> ſo that you would wonder to ſee the Change. You have heard in the Primitive Church of a Grain of Faith removing Mountains; The work of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> the beſtowing of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life on one dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, the making of a Carcaſs walk, the Natural Old Man to Spring again, and move ſpiritually, is as great a Miracle as that.</p>
            <p>Therefore called <hi>a Creation,</hi> becauſe of the neceſſity of Divine Grace, and the power of the Spirit of Chriſt, (that Power that made us at firſt, and raiſed Chriſt from the Dead;) 'Tis the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of that Power unto this Change, that is the principal ground of this term <hi>Creation.</hi> The Efficiency of it, by the power of victorious Grace, making us a willing, and holy People, in the day of his Power, comprehending habitual Sanctification, as the root and life of actual holineſs. The Excellency and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44317:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> Extent of this, I might ſhew, as to the inward and outward Man, Heart and Life; all the Powers of the Soul, and Members of the Body, and our whole Carriage, Courſe, and Behaviour; And that this is common unto all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, all that are created again in Chriſt Jeſus, all that are born from above; <hi>If any Man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature.</hi> To this end,</p>
            <p n="3">III. Let us conſider the certain and <hi>inſeparable connexion between theſe two,</hi> That all who are in Chriſt are, and muſt be new Creatures. Every real Chriſtian, he is in Chriſt Jeſus, his Union to Chriſt doth conſtitute him a living Member, and his being a New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth prove it. The one is the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the other his Property, but they are inſeparable.</p>
            <p>What makes <hi>a Man,</hi> but the Union of Soul and Body? What makes <hi>a Chriſtian,</hi> but the Union of the Soul with Chriſt? How know we that a Man hath a Soul, but by the Motions, Actions, Operations of a Reaſonable Soul? How know you that ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſtian is United to Chriſt by his Spirit, but by the Effects and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of this Spirit, making ſuch a Change in Heart and Life, from which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44317:19"/> they may be denominated <hi>New Creatures;</hi> Therefore they are ſaid <hi>to walk in the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>after the Spirit:</hi> And at other times, as the Foundation of this, to be <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>born from above;</hi> ſo as the Divine Life, and Likeneſs is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. But more particularly;</p>
            <p n="1">1. They who are thus ſpiritually uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt, they muſt be <hi>new creatures,</hi> becauſe they partake of the <hi>Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?</hi> the ſame Spirit that formed <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Womb of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> hath form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>new Creature</hi> in all that are in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> the ſame Spirit that quickned the dead Body of Chriſt, and raiſed him from the Dead, imploies the <hi>exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs af his Mighty Power towards them that believe,</hi> and by Faith are united to him: the ſame Spirit that carried out the Soul of Chriſt to go to God as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doth enable Believers to cry <hi>Abba Father.</hi> For the Spirit of Chriſt, is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Adoption,</hi> Gal. 4.6. The ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that led Chriſt into his Tryals and Temptations, and brought him off with Victory, doth the like for all the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt. <hi>They are partakers of his Spirit.</hi> The blood of Chriſt cannot ſave thoſe who are deſtitute of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>The ſame Spirit of Holineſs conforms them to the <hi>Image</hi> &amp; <hi>Life</hi> of God; they are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44317:20"/> under the conduct of the ſame Spirit of <hi>Humility, Meekneſs, Love, Charity, Prayer, Courage, Reſignation,</hi> and the like, which acted in Chriſt; And this makes them <hi>like to him;</hi> like him in their Judgments and Opinions of things; like him in their Affections, like him in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and Ends, and like him in a courſe of Actions, by which they proſecute thoſe Deſigns for the Glory of God. I might ſhew their Reſemblance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in <hi>Graces</hi> unto <hi>Christ,</hi> in the Riſe of them, in the Kinds of them, in the Exerciſe of them: All which depends upon their Participation of the ſame Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They muſt be <hi>new Creatures</hi> if they are in <hi>Chriſt</hi> becauſe the <hi>new Creature is an Imitation of Him.</hi> It is a little Module of Chriſt in its <hi>Birth,</hi> and a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his Pattern in its <hi>Growth,</hi> and fully ſo in its <hi>Perfection.</hi> And therefore we read of coming to a <hi>perfect man,</hi> to the <hi>meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ 4.12. All that are united to <hi>Chriſt</hi> are conformed to him. Every <hi>Branch</hi> in him anſwers to the <hi>Root;</hi> every <hi>Member</hi> ſuits to the <hi>holy Head</hi> in Heaven, and in ſome meaſure doth reſemble him. That the Members of Chriſt ſhould be of a contrary Temper to their Head, is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impoſſible.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:44317:20"/>
            <p>I might here urge the Imitation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as becoming thoſe who profeſs to be <hi>in him,</hi> in ſeveral Inſtances: as in the inward Delight which he took to do <hi>the will of his Father,</hi> in his <hi>active Zeal</hi> for his <hi>Father's Glory,</hi> in a patient ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the hand of his Father, tho' never <hi>ſo heavy,</hi> in his firm Faith and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on him under all Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and in his Conſtancy and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance to do good, notwithſtanding all the Hatred and Malice of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe the <hi>New Creature</hi> is Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in Scripture as a <hi>Conformity</hi> to the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection of Chriſt,</hi> Philip. 3.10. By putting off the <hi>old man,</hi> we dye unto <hi>Sin;</hi> by putting on <hi>the new,</hi> we are <hi>alive to God,</hi> and <hi>live to Righteouſneſs.</hi> We are hereby <hi>changed into the Image of Chriſt,</hi> and that <hi>good work begun,</hi> which is to be <hi>finiſh'd</hi> and <hi>conſummated</hi> in the <hi>Day of Chriſt</hi> Phil. 1.6. There is a <hi>Conformity to his Death and Sufferings,</hi> in the <hi>mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sin. Our old man is crucified with him,</hi> Rom. 6.6. Gal. 5.24. And a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> in <hi>Heavenli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind, Col.</hi> 3.1. and in <hi>Newneſs of Life,</hi> Rom. 6.4.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe nothing elſe will ſo prove our <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to Chriſt,</hi> as to enable us to take
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44317:21"/> Comfort in ſuch a Priviledge; no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Advantages whatſoever will do it. For <hi>neither circumciſion, nor uncumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on availeth any thing, but a new Creature,</hi> Gal. 6.15. The higheſt Profeſſion of Religion without ſuch a <hi>Change,</hi> will not ſave thee. <hi>Except a man be born again,</hi> or <hi>from above, he cannot enter into Heaven,</hi> John. 3.5. Neither can he be <hi>accepted of God,</hi> or <hi>have fellowſhip with him,</hi> 1 John 3.2.</p>
            <p>No External Duties or Performances will avail you without this: You may Read, and Hear, and Pray, and give Alms, and do many other things, and yet not be <hi>in Chriſt;</hi> if you are not Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, Renewed, and inwardly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by the Power of the <hi>Divine Spirit:</hi> If you are not made <hi>New Creatures,</hi> you can never prove that you are <hi>in Christ</hi> You may be Baptized in the <hi>Name of the Sacred Trinity;</hi> you may continue in the <hi>Boſom of the Church;</hi> hear the <hi>ſound of the glorious Goſpel,</hi> and receive the <hi>Bread and Wine in the Lord's Supper,</hi> and yet not be <hi>united unto Chriſt.</hi> You may have ſome <hi>leſſer change</hi> from the <hi>groſſer Pollutions</hi> of the World; you may have ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reformation, which is far ſhort of being <hi>new Creatures;</hi> ſome outward tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary change, in your carriage &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44317:21"/> while the Heart is unrenew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In a word, our preſent Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Communion with God, our after Service and Obedience in the Fruits of Righteouſneſs, to the praiſe of God, and our final Bleſſedneſs in the enjoyment of him, do all depend upon this Change, this new Creation; And therefore be aſſured, <hi>None can be in Chriſt without it;</hi> none in Chriſt, ſo as to have any ſpecial, diſtinguiſhing, ſaving Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application</hi> 1. <hi>Are none in Chriſt but new creatures?</hi> How many then muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded? How many of excellent and laudable Qualifications, of great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments and high Profeſſions, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Accompliſhments, muſt yet he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and ſhut out from having any part in Chriſt; becauſe they are yet Strangers to this <hi>New creation;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently are not in Chriſt, but under condemnation. Meer Civility, and a plauſible inoffenſive Carriage is quite another thing. We need but view the Lives and Actions of the generality of ſuch as are called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to confirm this, That the Number is but ſmall of thoſe who are in Chriſt: How few have had any awakening Convictions about theſe things? and many ſuch miſcarry.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:44317:22"/>2. How miſerable is the condition of all unrenewed Souls; without a change, they are excluded from all <hi>ſaving benefit</hi> by the <hi>Redeemer.</hi> They are not in Chriſt, and therefore are under the Curſe and Condemnation; which by <hi>union to Chriſt</hi> we are delivered from, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Know ye not, that Christ is in you, except ye are Reprobates?</hi> 2 Cor. 13.6. All our hopes of Life and Salvation by Chriſt depend upon it: The Guilt of all our Sins doth otherwiſe lye upon us; And all the black Clouds of Divine Vengeance hang over our heads; The Wrath of God bides upon us; as if there were no <hi>Chriſt,</hi> no <hi>Goſpel:</hi> And there is nothing between us and Everlaſting Ruine, but a little Breadth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then none but <hi>New Creatures</hi> have a Right to <hi>the Lord's Table;</hi> For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited Gueſts are ſuch who are <hi>in Chriſt.</hi> The Covenant of Grace cannot be ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that <hi>Ordinance,</hi> to thoſe who are not under the <hi>Bond of the Covenant;</hi> The Benefits purchaſed by Chriſt are not confirmed at his <hi>Table</hi> unto thoſe, who are none of his: I grant there is an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, as to <hi>preſent frame,</hi> that even thoſe who are <hi>in Chriſt</hi> may have; but it is the Unworthineſs <hi>as to ſtate,</hi> that I am ſpeaking of: Such as are not in

They were the firſt and loweſt Leſſons, fitted to the Infancy of the Church; But now <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is come, by

            </p>
            <p>And certainly <hi>the changes of the year paſt</hi> ſhould be very <hi>inſtructive,</hi> and give us many <hi>Reflexions,</hi> according to our <hi>Sins,</hi> and <hi>Mercies;</hi> according to the <hi>Trials,</hi> and <hi>Exerciſes</hi> we have been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through, this laſt year. May not all of you look back upon many Changes the preceding year, of ſeveral kinds; thoſe eſpecially which God hath made amongſt us by <hi>Death?</hi> We are called to review, how many of them we knew, and were acquainted with, with whom we familiarly converſed, not a Year ſince, are now ſilent in the duſt: While their immortal Spirits are ſome in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and others in the <hi>place of Torment.</hi> And of the multitude that have dyed this laſt year, could we but ſeparate the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, putrifying Relicks of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whom we Honoured, Valued, and Loved, from the reſt of the Deceaſed, and view their Bodies, as now they are; How affecting would be the <hi>Spectacle?</hi> to think <hi>what they were,</hi> leſs than a year
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44317:30"/> ago; and to conſider, <hi>what now they are, as to their Bodies;</hi> and the greater change there is as to <hi>their Souls.</hi> But even as to the <hi>former,</hi> let us compare in our thoughts the Figure they lately made, while act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Parts upon this Stage, as living Men and Women amongſt us; What a Change is made in a few Months, as to every of them? And the like may be our own Caſe, within a few Months from this moment, long before the end of this year we now begin.</p>
            <p>For conſider it, <hi>Christians,</hi> This laſt year, that is now ended, is one great ſtep we have every one made towards the Grave. Another ſuch may bring us home. O that we may be found ready! Who knows, but as <hi>the laſt Year</hi> carried off many of our Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Friends, but that our Names may be amongſt thoſe who ſhall not out-live <hi>this?</hi> It is true, <hi>It may be,</hi> you ſhall live to ſee the Concluſion of this New-year, <hi>but, it may be, you ſhall not live till Midſummer.</hi> It may be, I may Preach a Twelve-month hence; but peradventure you may hear a Sermon occaſioned by my Death, before that time; Or your own ears may be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, if my mouth be not: <hi>You may die,</hi> if I ſhould live yet a few years more.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:44317:30"/>
            <p>I cannot look round on this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but I muſt conclude, that of all this number, it is paſt doubt, but <hi>ſome one</hi> or more will dye before this year be over; I believe I need not ſcruple to pronounce it. There is none can que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but if the number were much leſs, one or more would dye within a year. Therefore the Voice of God is to <hi>every one of you,</hi> Awake and mind your Work; Turn to the Lord, and ſeek after Union to Chriſt, and ſee that you be <hi>New creatures,</hi> for <hi>you ſhall die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another year.</hi>

            <p>But you will <hi>almoſt All</hi> be ready to ſay, To whom, in particular, do you ſpeak this? <hi>Sure not to me.</hi> Yes, I ſpeak it <hi>to you,</hi> to <hi>every of you,</hi> whether in <hi>Youth</hi> or <hi>Age;</hi> To you <hi>Parents,</hi> and to you that are <hi>Children;</hi> To you <hi>Masters,</hi> and to you <hi>Servants;</hi> To you <hi>Husbands,</hi> and to you <hi>Wives;</hi> To you before me, and to you on either hand; This Call of God is to <hi>every one of you</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>See that you be found in Chriſt, for you may not be found alive, at the end of this year.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh but I hope the contrary, ſay ſuch and ſuch; <hi>As for me, I hope I have many a fair year to come; I am in ſprightly vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Youth, <hi>or I am in ſetled confirmed</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:44317:31"/> Stength, <hi>and</hi> Health, <hi>or I am but juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the buſie World; or juſt now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon it,</hi> &amp;c. But, <hi>How many younger, and more likely to live, have died this laſt year;</hi> and therefore why may not <hi>you</hi> be one of thoſe, who ſhall dye this?</p>
            <p>Nay, <hi>Elder Perſons</hi> are ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves and ſay, <hi>They have</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Seniors <hi>to go before them; That many who are Elder than they, they ſee, do yet hold out year after year. Their inward thought is, that they have eſcaped many Dangers, and been recovered from many Sickneſſes; And though they are but weak and crazy, and have many Infirmities, and Pains, to preſage their Diſſolution; Yet notwithſtanding theſe, they make a ſhift to live, and have rubbed on for ſeveral years, under ſuch weakneſs; And ſeveral of their Acquaintance, as weak and ſickly as they, have continued a good while for all that.</hi> And ſo, neither <hi>Young,</hi> nor <hi>Old,</hi> will admit the Suppoſition, as to <hi>their own caſe;</hi> Nor <hi>You,</hi> nor <hi>You,</hi> nor <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body,</hi> will believe they ſhall <hi>dye this year.</hi> And ſo <hi>the next year,</hi> I doubt not, your Hearts will ſay the ſame as <hi>now;</hi> for there will be the ſame pretence: And therefore it is <hi>not unto you</hi> I muſt ſpeak of <hi>Death,</hi> but rather wiſh you <hi>Joy</hi> of the <hi>long Life,</hi> which with ſo much confidence you reckon upon. Well,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44317:31"/> 
               <hi>Shall I ſay then,</hi> 
               <q>Go and enjoy this World, and live as you liſt, if you durſt put it to the Venture; Go, and gratifie your Senſes, Appetites and Luſts, for <hi>this year,</hi> as you did <hi>the laſt;</hi> and never think of <hi>Death,</hi> or fear it: You are not like to dye <hi>this year,</hi> or <hi>the next?</hi>
               </q> But, How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable is ſuch Security, when ſome one or more of this Aſſembly, you grant, will probably, or moſt certainly dye this year: And how can you be <hi>certain,</hi> that you ſhall be <hi>the Exempted Perſon;</hi> Or that your <hi>near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Relations,</hi> and thoſe you love beſt, That they ſhall <hi>not dye this year?</hi> Your Parents, your Paſtors, your Husbands, and your Wives, and your Children; and your Boſom Friends; you will as hardly admit the thoughts that they ſhall dye <hi>this year;</hi> But if ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe, that now hear me, that now look upon me, that now liſten, and attend to what I ſay, ſhould be called away to Judgment <hi>before another year;</hi> Why may not <hi>you in particular</hi> be the Perſons, or <hi>the Deſire of your eyes,</hi> thoſe whoſe Lives are deareſt to you?</p>
            <p>Certainly To begin the year with ſuch a Thought, can do you no harm,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44317:32"/> but may be improved to many uſeful purpoſes. However, I muſt tell you, If, after all <hi>the Changes</hi> which we have ſeen within <hi>a Twelve month,</hi> (and which every year brings freſh experience of,) we will not look forward to our own great change; If we will not heartily concern our ſelves for our greateſt, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Intereſt, and prepare for an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting State, by voluntary, vital Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Son of God; <hi>I muſt tell you,</hi> for a Concluſion, That <hi>God chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not.</hi> And if neither the Voice of his Providence, nor the Voice of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; If neither the Calls of the Word, nor the Motions of the Spirit; If neither the Experience of others nor ſo much as we have had of our own, will awaken us to <hi>change our courſe.</hi> You muſt know, that the Holineſs of God, his Juſtice, and his Truth, are <hi>unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:</hi> He will not alter the terms of Life for you and me, He will not find another way, for us to eſcape Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, than by <hi>being in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>being New creatures.</hi> Therefore look to it that you be found <hi>ſuch.</hi> And in wiſhing, and praying you may all be <hi>Such,</hi> I do not only <hi>wiſh you a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py New year;</hi> But a happy Life, if it be for <hi>many years,</hi> And withal, <hi>a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44317:32"/> Eternity</hi> after Death, which ſuch as are now in Chriſt, ſhall then En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy with him, when Days and Years, and Time, ſhall be no more. <hi>God grant it for Christ's ſake.</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <p>When Jeſus had ſpoken theſe words, he went forth with his Diſciples over the Brook <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,</hi> where was a Garden; into the which he entred, and his Diſciples; And <hi>Judas</hi> alſo which betrayed him, knew the place; For Jeſus oft times reſorted thither with his Diſciples.</p>

            <p>UPon <hi>Thurſday,</hi> the Day before the <hi>Crucifixion of our Lord,</hi> he goes to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from <hi>Bethany,</hi> and there eats the <hi>Paſſover</hi> with his Diſciples; at the end whereof he inſtitutes the Sacrament of the Supper, and then makes a large Pathetical Diſcourſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44317:34"/> in the 15th and 16th <hi>Chapters.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which followed his admirable Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Prayer in the 17th <hi>Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now having ſaid, and done this, having ſaid theſe words, and ſung an Hymn with his Diſciples, <hi>he goes forth with his Diſciples over the Brook</hi> Cedron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews,</hi> it is true, did not go out of their Houſes that Night, after the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Paſſover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.22, 24. Becauſe of the Angels paſſing by the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when the firſt born of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were to be cut off; That the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might not mix with the <hi>Egyptians</hi> at that time, but ſprinkle the Blood of the Paſchal Lamb on their own Door-poſts, as a Mark of Diſtinction. Whereas our Lord having abrogated the Paſſover, and inſtituted his Supper to ſucceed in its room; all the Precepts that concern the <hi>Jewiſh Paſſover,</hi> with all the <hi>Appendixes</hi> belonging to it, were made Null, and of no Effect; and conſequently our Saviour might go out that Evening; eſpecially when the <hi>Jews</hi> tarried within door, to avoid ſuffering the Wrath of the Angel; but he goes forth that Evening to meet with ſuffering: For <hi>he knew that</hi> Judas <hi>would betray him that Night, and that he was well acquainted with the place he went to;</hi> for he was wont to retire thither with his Diſciples.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:44317:34"/>
            <p>He went forth when he was to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed and taken, as afterwards he ſuffered Death <hi>without the Gate of the City.</hi> He went out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> thereby declaring, it is thought, That <hi>the Gentiles</hi> had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in his Sufferings, as well as the <hi>Jews;</hi> That it was not that particular People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone he was to ſuffer for, but the reſt of the World were to be equal Sharers in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of his Paſſion. <hi>He went forth with his Diſciples, over the Brook</hi> Cedron, <hi>where was a Garden, into which he entred,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In theſe Two Verſes we may conſider,

                  <item>1. The <hi>Place</hi> he paſſed over, <hi>the Brook</hi> Cedron.</item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>Company</hi> that was with him, <hi>his Diſciples.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>laſtly,</hi> I ſhall conſider what <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inſtructions</hi> may be gathered from the whole, for our own Uſe.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:44317:35"/>1. The <hi>Place</hi> over which he paſſed, <hi>the Brook Cedron;</hi> a little Rivulet of that name, between the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> that ran through a dark deep Valley. In Summer it was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten dry, and in Winter, or after the fall of any conſiderable Rains, it was full. The curſed things were burnt here, when <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> purged the Temple and City of Idolatry. The Filth and Unclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Temple was caſt into this Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, through which this Brook ran, that our Lord paſſed over. Which may mind us of his being made Sin, and a Curſe for us, to aboliſh the Curſe of the Law, to purge us from our Filthineſs, and to bring about everlaſting Righteouſneſs for us.</p>
            <p>As hardly Two Circumſtances of our Saviour's Paſſion, but had a Type; ſo in this, for inſtance, we have an eminent one, in <hi>David</hi>'s going over the <hi>Brook Cedron,</hi> when, by the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of his Son <hi>Abſolon,</hi> he was forced to quit the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15th <hi>Chapter. David</hi> was then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by his own Subjects, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by his own Countrymen; and as <hi>He,</hi> and all the People <hi>wept,</hi> when they went over the Brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> to the aſcent of the <hi>Mount of Olives;</hi> Our Lord, when he went over this <hi>Brook,</hi> retired to a <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> on a part of that Mount, and there
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44317:35"/> prayed himſelf into an Agony, and <hi>wept Tears of Blood.</hi> As ſoon as <hi>David</hi> had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over this Brook to the <hi>Mount of Olives,</hi> he worſhipped God, and poured out a Prayer, recorded in the 3d <hi>Pſalm.</hi> So did our Lord pour out ſtrong Crys and Interceſſions to God, on the ſame Mountain, when he had paſſed over this very Brook <hi>Cedron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this <hi>firſt Particular,</hi> before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further, we may learn to expect, in imitation of Chriſt, to follow him in the like path; to go through the dark Valley of Suffering, before we come to God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mountain. As he paſſed over the Brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> to the <hi>Mount of Olives,</hi> we muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend likewiſe by the Croſs, to God's holy Hill. But for our Encouragement, we may conſider too, That he having drank of the Brook by the war, hath ſanctified the bittereſt Cup of Affliction unto us. This little <hi>Brook,</hi> this <hi>Rivulet,</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been fordable for us, but we muſt have been drowned in the Waters of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,</hi> if he had not paſſed over before us. But now a Cup of Conſolation is put into our hands, he hath prepared a Path for us to <hi>Mount Olivet,</hi> he hath ſmoothed our way to God's holy Hill, by his own Sufferings and Death; ſo as we need not fear to walk
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44317:36"/> through the Valley of the ſhadow of Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us conſider the <hi>Company,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our Lord paſſed over this Brook, <hi>with his Diſciples.</hi> There may be <hi>Two Accounts</hi> of this, the <hi>one,</hi> in reference to their future preaching of the Goſpel; the <hi>other,</hi> for their more reſolute and couragious ſuffering for it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>As to their future preaching of the Goſpel.</hi> It was fit and neceſſary the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſhould be Spectators of the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Paſſages of our Lord's ſuffering; Not only becauſe ſome of them were to write the Hiſtory of his Life and Death, and tranſmit this Everlaſting Goſpel to <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Generations;</hi> But they were alſo to Preach to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in the Name of Chriſt; and what more <hi>powerful Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> could they uſe to gain Credit to what they ſaid, than by being able to atteſt the <hi>Truth</hi> of their Hiſtory by their own Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and to ſay upon their own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>We ſpeak that which we have ſeen and heard.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt <hi>John</hi> we find inſiſt much on this, <hi>We cannot but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen, Acts</hi> 4 10. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hereby they might not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly be the better fitted for their Miniſtry to Preach in his Name, but be <hi>thereby the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44317:36"/> to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> His Example of Patience, and Meekneſs, and Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might be of ſingular Uſe to them upon that account. He had foretold and forewarned them by his Diſcourſe in the way, That they <hi>muſt</hi> expect to <hi>ſuffer.</hi> He had told them, that <hi>when the Shepherd was ſmitten, the Sheep ſhould be ſcattered.</hi> And what more likely to animate them to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Perſeverance, than the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their Lord's <hi>Voluntary Suffering?</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if in any meaſure they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Deſign and Reaſon, and End of his <hi>Suffering:</hi> For if he <hi>drank</hi> of the Brook in the way, they might well expect to <hi>taſte</hi> of it; If he travelled through the dark Valley, they could not expect a ſmooth and a pleaſant Path to Glory; if he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the Contradictions of Sinners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, they could not think that they ſhould eſcape Oppoſition. Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, and not think it <hi>strange,</hi> if we meet with <hi>ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage</hi> as our Lord and his Followers have already done.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may learn from the Influence their Preſence with Chriſt might have <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their future Miniſtry,</hi> by being eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the <hi>Truths</hi> that they delivered, That <hi>if ever Miniſters would perſwade others to believe any Doctrine, the beſt Expedient is to endeavour to be fully perſwaded our ſelves
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44317:37"/> of the Truth and Certainty of thoſe things that we deliver.</hi> No wonder if other Men are not perſwaded by <hi>us,</hi> if we ſpeak to them <hi>ſuch things</hi> as we believe not <hi>our ſelves;</hi> or do either Preach, or live in ſuch a manner as to give them reaſon to think ſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the other Reaſon, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them to <hi>patient ſuffering,</hi> we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That the <hi>Example of Chriſt's Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Conſtancy ſhould be very influential upon all his Followers; and if duly conſidered is like to be ſo.</hi> For he is <hi>our Captain</hi> and <hi>Forerunner,</hi> we are to follow him, and fill up that which remains of his <hi>Sufferings.</hi> All that we can <hi>ſuffer</hi> is but the gleaning of the Vintage, after he has trodden the Wine-Preſs alone. God hath ſpoken it once, yea twice have we heard it; <hi>that is,</hi> in the Old Teſtament, and in the New, That Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are the way to Glory; That ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are the Afflictions of the Righteous; That through many Tribulations we muſt enter into Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Circumſtance of <hi>Time</hi> is next to be conſidered, When our Lord paſſed over the Brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> viz. After he had inſtituted the Sacrament of the ſupper, After he had ſpoken thoſe words of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and Inſtruction to his Diſciples, and of Petition to his Father, <hi>Then he
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44317:37"/> walked over the Brook Cedron with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> He went forth to meet with ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and his Diſciples were with him. How admirable is the Wiſdom and Condeſcenſion of our merciful Saviour, thus to antidote and ſore-arm his poor Diſciples, thus to prepare and diſpoſe his faint hearted Followers to be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his ſufferings and Partakers of them: For after ſuch a bleſſed Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, what ſhould be able to ſink their Spirits? After they had Joined in ſuch an Ordinance, as the Lords ſupper, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by Chriſt himſelf; After they had received ſuch excellent Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and heard ſuch a ſermon from his own Mouth; After they had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, when he put up ſuch a Prayer to God, as that recorded in the 17. of <hi>John<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> what could diſhearten them, or damp their Courage?</p>
            <p>We may hence take notice, That <hi>the participation of Solemn Ordinances, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God therein, is an excellent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative to more than ordinary Trialls</hi> What better preparation for patient and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſuffering for Chriſt, than the Lords Supper, wherein we remember his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love that ſhould engage us to it? And ſo for other Afflictions, even the Calamities common to men, The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44317:38"/> Bread may be our ſtaff, and ſtrength to fortifie, and confirm our Minds againſt all Difficulties; The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Wine may be a Cordial to our fainting Spirits, to inbolden us againſt all Diſcouragments. On this Account, they that neglect this Ordinance are wanting to themſelves, as to prepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for, and ſupport in a time of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And for this Reaſon, we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the primitive Chriſtians did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate ſo often, <hi>every Lords Day,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>every Day,</hi> whenever they met for publick Worſhip, becauſe they were in continual Jeopardy of their Lives: And the multitude of <hi>Martyrs</hi> in thoſe times, and their invincible Patience, and Perſeverance, was much owing to this, and influenced by it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let us conſider <hi>the place he retired to,</hi> when he went over the Brook Cedron, viz: <hi>The Garden of Gethſemane.</hi> The word <hi>Gethſemane</hi> ſignifies an Oile-preſs. It was a little village ſcituated at the foot of <hi>the Mount of Olives,</hi> on which Mountain there were many <hi>Olive-trees,</hi> and ſo many <hi>Oil-preſſes</hi> in that <hi>Village.</hi> The <hi>Mount of Olives</hi> hath its name with relation to this; and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> writers call it ſometimes <hi>the Mountain of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> ſometimes <hi>the Mountain of Light,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44317:38"/> 
               <hi>the Mountain of Health,</hi> becauſe of the uſe of Oyl as to all theſe.</p>
            <p>This Garden of <hi>Gethſemane,</hi> as ſome think, was firſt planted by <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> and then enlarged and beautified by ſucceeding Princes, for their Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Delight. If that be true, where they took their pleaſure, the Meſſias, the true Son of <hi>David,</hi> began his Paſſion; in memory whereof <hi>Hellen,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards built a Chappel there, which was viſible in the days of <hi>Jerom;</hi> and ſome affirm the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> the Mother of our Lord, was Buried in, or near this place. But to paſs that as doubtful, it is very probable, that in or near this Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, (near Jeruſalem,) many of the rich Citizens had their Gardens, and Country-Houſes, and among them ſome of Chriſts Followers, who gave him and his twelve Diſciples Entertainment, therefore it is ſaid, <hi>he often reſorted thither,</hi> with his Diſciples. But,</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Why</hi> he did ſo is more to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to inquire: Why our Lord choſe this place to prepare himſelf for his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and to begin his Agony. And this may be anſwered in three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:44317:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. The <hi>firſt</hi> ſin was committed in a <hi>Garden,</hi> and therefore the beginning of our Lords Paſſion, for the expiation of ſion, did very fitly begin in a <hi>Garden</hi> too. It was in a <hi>Garden</hi> that man began to ſin, and in ſuch a place, the Son of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his Sufferings. <hi>The firſt Adam</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs the Wrath and Diſpleaſure of God in a <hi>Garden; The ſecond Adam</hi> trembles, and groans, and ſweats, and prays, for the turning away of that Wrath from us in a <hi>Garden</hi> too, he there began his <hi>Paſſion</hi> for our <hi>Recovery.</hi> Our <hi>first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> loſt the Image of God by their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, and heard the Sentence of Condemnation in a <hi>Garden,</hi> our Lord comes to reſtore the Divine Image, and reverſe the <hi>Sentence of Condemnation,</hi> by his <hi>bloody ſufferings,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> which begin in this <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>Gethſemane,</hi> as the Promiſe of it was firſt made in the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> of <hi>Eden, that the Seed of the Woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpents-head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Compare <hi>Eden</hi> and <hi>Gethſemane.</hi> We were firſt ſeduced by the <hi>old Serpent</hi> in the <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>Eden;</hi> and his Head was bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Agony,</hi> and <hi>Bloody Paſſion of Chriſt,</hi> which began in this <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>Gethſemane.</hi> In <hi>the one Garden,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil conquered <hi>the firſt Adam;</hi> but is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by <hi>the ſecond Adam</hi> in <hi>the other,</hi> when
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44317:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> he reſolved to drink the cup, ſaying, <hi>Not my Will, but thine be done.</hi> In the <hi>firſt Garden,</hi> that of <hi>Eden,</hi> man <hi>ſurfeited</hi> on the <hi>forbidden Fruit,</hi> and fell from God, for which our bleſſed Redeemer had a <hi>bloody Sweat</hi> in the <hi>Second,</hi> the <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>Gethſemane.</hi> We were turned out of the <hi>earthly Paradiſe</hi> by <hi>ſinning in the first;</hi> we have the Purchace of the <hi>heavenly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe</hi> by our <hi>Lord's Suffering,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>in the ſecond.</hi> The <hi>beginning</hi> of our Calamity, and of all the miſeries of Mankind, had its riſe in the <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>Eden:</hi> And the <hi>beginning</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias Paſſion</hi> for our recovery, was in the Garden of <hi>Gethſemane; There</hi> our Lord ſigned the Decree for his own Crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by his <hi>bloody Sweat,</hi> as the Pledge and earneſt of his ſhedding his Blood, the next day, upon the Croſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another, and more evident Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why our Lord choſe this <hi>Garden,</hi> was becauſe it was a <hi>ſolitary place,</hi> fit for <hi>Meditation,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>the more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Preparation of himſelf for his Crucifixion,</hi> which was now ſo near. He was now in proſpect of his approaching Death, he knew that within a few Hours he ſhould be Apprehended and Taken, Judged, and Condemned to a <hi>ſhameful
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44317:40" rendition="simple:additions"/> Croſs;</hi> and therefore retires here for <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> in order to it. To bear the Curſe of the Law, and ſtrugle with the <hi>Wrath of God,</hi> the due Wages of our ſin, which he undertook to expiate; And to Conflict with all thoſe <hi>Sufferings,</hi> Antecedent and Concomitant to ſuch a <hi>Death,</hi> needed ſuch Preparation. Yea, the <hi>ſolemn Reſignation</hi> of himſelf to the Will of God, <hi>by Prayer,</hi> in this <hi>Garden,</hi> before he Offered himſelf upon the Croſs, was neceſſary, as the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a legal <hi>Type,</hi> that prefigured it: For all the <hi>Levitical Sacrifices</hi> were firſt conſecrated by <hi>Prayer,</hi> before they were burnt upon the <hi>Altar.</hi> This Lamb of God, the truth of all thoſe Sacrifices, the Subſtance of all thoſe Types, was firſt to devote himſelf to God <hi>by Prayer,</hi> before he was nailed to the Croſs; And this Garden of <hi>Gethſemane,</hi> being a ſolitary Place, was fit for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I may add another reaſon, He went thither <hi>becauſe it was a place that Judas knew of,</hi> where his Enemi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s might be ſure to find him, and ſo accompliſh the eternal Counſels of God concerning his ſufferings and Death. Several times before this, they endeavoured to lay hands on him, but <hi>his hour was not come;</hi> But now he was
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44317:40"/> willing, and reſolved to dye; And therefore knowing that Judas would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him, and having bid him <hi>do quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> what he intended to do, he doth not go about to abſcond, and hide himſelf to prevent it; He retires to this Garden which the Traytor was well acquainted with: And when he comes with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to take him, he tells them more than once, He is the Perſon they ſeek for.</p>
            <p>Let me make a few Reflexions on this particular. As 1. Since our Lords Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on began in a <hi>Garden,</hi> Let me caution you not to abuſe your Gardens, and places of Retirement, and Recreation, to vanity and ſin; but improve them by holy Meditation, when you are walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there. How often is Chriſt diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured in ſuch places, either when you are in Company, or when are alone? <hi>In company,</hi> by intemperance in Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or by vain or wanton Diſcourſes, or by uncharitable and backbiting Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of others &amp;c. Or when you are <hi>alone,</hi> by wanton and luſtful thoughts, by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative uncleanneſs, wicked projects &amp;c. But thus to retire into a Garden, is to retreat from men, and fall into the hands of the Devil. Such perſons imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their Mother <hi>Eve</hi> in the Garden of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44317:41"/> 
               <hi>Eden,</hi> and hold a Dialogue with the <hi>old ſerpent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others, who are leſs criminal, are yet to be reproved, that make no holy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of ſuch places, but only for Recreation and Pleaſure, to gratifie their Senſes. Every wiſe and good man loves ſometimes to be <hi>alone,</hi> and ought to be ſo, <hi>for ſerious Meditation:</hi> Now a Garden is a fit place for ſuch a purpoſe, and may be of excellent uſe to ſuch an end; And there is no Object can meet our Eyes, or affect any of our ſenſes there, without giving us ſome Notices of God, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting us to ſome uſeful Inſtructions in reference to our ſelves, if we did not want a holy heart and ſpiritual wiſdom to improve them.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially in your <hi>Garden walks</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on <hi>the Garden of Eden,</hi> and think of <hi>this Garden of Gethſemane.</hi> Conſider how Man ſinned in the <hi>one,</hi> and how <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffered in an Agony in the <hi>other. First,</hi> From the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> you may take occaſion to contemplate the State of Innocence, the Entrance of Sin, the Fall of our Firſt Parents, the Subtilty of the Tempter, the Danger of Gratifying the Senſual Appetite, from their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Eating the Forbidden Fruit; the prevalency of Temptation, when a near
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44317:41"/> and Beloved Relation is the Inſtrument of the Devil, to urge it, <hi>&amp;c. Secondly,</hi> Think of the Garden of <hi>Gethſemane</hi> too, when you are delighting your ſelf in ſome <hi>pleaſant Walk</hi> in your own <hi>Garden.</hi> Think how the Son of God lay proſtrate on his Face in an Agony, in this <hi>Garden of Gethſemane.</hi> When you look upon a Fruit-tree, eſpecially a Vine, or taſte of a Grape, remember the <hi>Blood of Chriſt,</hi> that trickled from his Sacred Body. If you are ſometimes merry and chearful with your Friends in a <hi>Garden,</hi> forget not how your Saviour was <hi>exceeding ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful; My Soul is exceeding Sorrowful unto Death.</hi> When you are cooling your ſelves in the Shade, remember his <hi>Agony,</hi> and <hi>Bloody Sweat,</hi> under the Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Wrath of God, due to your ſin; How his Soul <hi>boiled up,</hi> as one of the <hi>Greek Expreſſions</hi> does ſignifie, and his Blood broke out at every part of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with the extremity of the Heat. You may conſider how <hi>the Firſt Adam</hi> was Tempted by <hi>an Evil Angel</hi> in the <hi>Garden of Eden,</hi> and <hi>the Second</hi> was Comforted in his Agony by <hi>a Good one. Adam's</hi> Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the former, was, to get his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>by the Sweat of his brows; Chriſt,</hi> by <hi>his Bloody Sweat,</hi> in this procures our Life. And let not ſuch places be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44317:42"/> to ſin and vanity, that may ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be improved, to put us in mind of ſuch <hi>Important Truths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In that this was <hi>a Solitary Place,</hi> we may obſerve, That it is fit to retire for <hi>Meditation</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> to ſome <hi>Secret Place,</hi> from the Company, and Obſervation of others. There are many things, which are proper enough, and may become us in an Affectionate Prayer <hi>in ſecret,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for a <hi>Penitent,</hi> which are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable in Social Worſhip, or Publick Prayer with others; As Proſtration of our ſelves on the Ground, Beating the Breaſt, Extraordinary Sobs and Sighs, Plentiful Tears, and Paſſionate Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulations with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which either Modeſty, or Prudence may reſtrain in publick, may be uſed with greater Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in Secret, where is no Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Hypocriſie, or vain-glory to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe them. And therefore our Lord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us, <hi>Math.</hi> 6. That we <hi>enter into our Cloſets, and ſhut the door, and then pray to our Father, who is in Heaven, who ſeeth in ſecret, and will reward us openly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In that Chriſt retires here, to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf,</hi> with the greater Solemnity, <hi>for his approaching Death;</hi> We may learn,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44317:42"/> That whenever we have a Proſpect of our Change at hand, we ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves with <hi>habitual preparation,</hi> but uſe a <hi>more ſolemn, distinct,</hi> and <hi>actual preparation</hi> for it. Our Lord, no doubt, was always in a Readineſs, for that which he knew was the great end of his Incarnation: And yet the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Sufferings, he retires into this <hi>Garden</hi> to prepare himſelf for that hour. We ſhould always ſo live, as to be fit to die, becauſe every hour we make ſome ſteps towards the Grave: Every thought, every word, is a Sand running from the Glaſs of Time: We <hi>ſleep</hi> every night in the outer Chambers of Death, and ſhould, by Prayer, prepare our ſelves for <hi>it,</hi> even for <hi>that Image of Death:</hi> And ſhall we not, much more, for <hi>Death it ſelf,</hi> when we have a Proſpect of its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach? in whoſe Arms we muſt reſt Priſoners, till the great Morning of the <hi>Reſurrection?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If God give us Notice and Warning by Old Age, or a dangerous Sickneſs, or a <hi>languiſhing</hi> Body, or by any other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, that we ſhall ſhortly leave this World; Solemn, actual Preparation in ſuch a caſe is fit and neceſſary; If God tell any of you by a Bodily Sickneſs, your Change is near; If the Decays and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44317:43"/> Infirmities of Old Age, (the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable of all Diſeaſes,) tell you, That you have not long to live, that it is high time to ſet your Hearts, and your Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in order; You ought actually to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, ſolemnly to do ſo. You that have one foot in the Grave already, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not this, leaſt the Devil trip up the other before you are <hi>Ready.</hi> But <hi>you</hi> that have ſerved the Lord from <hi>your Youth,</hi> and have the comfortable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of <hi>your</hi> paſt ſincerity, in walking with God; <hi>you</hi> may rejoyce upon any ſuch <hi>Summons,</hi> that <hi>your Race</hi> is almoſt <hi>run; Your warfare</hi> will ſhortly be <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; you</hi> have but a few ſteps more of <hi>your pilgrimage</hi> to make; a few Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations more to reſiſt; a very little time longer of trial and conflict; before <hi>you</hi> ſhall receive the <hi>End of your Faith and Hope,</hi> and be <hi>for ever with the Lord.</hi> Should <hi>you</hi> not then, with ſuch a warning, ſtir up the Grace of God, quicken holy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, ſtrengthen Faith, and exerciſe it about the Inviſible World, and ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſign <hi>your ſelves</hi> into the Arms of the Redeemer?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe this was <hi>the place that Judas knew of,</hi> were he might find our Lord, and betray him; Let us take notice of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44317:43"/> 
               <hi>Chriſt's willingneſs, and Reſolvedneſs to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Death,</hi> and what an Obligation it lays upon us of <hi>Love and Gratitude</hi> to this Merciful Saviour. This I ſhall a little urge, as <hi>ſuitable</hi> to the paſt <hi>Solemnity</hi> of this <hi>day</hi> to make <hi>us</hi> Thankful, who have been Partakers of the Memorials of his dying <hi>Love,</hi> in <hi>the Sacrament of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was <hi>free</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> in Suffering. He went to the place which <hi>Judas</hi> knew of, though he knew <hi>Judas</hi> would come, and betray him. He freely offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Council of God, to undertake <hi>our Redemption;</hi> He <hi>voluntarily</hi> quitted his Fathers Boſom in the fulneſs of Time, to aſſume our Nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuffer and die. He was not forced into a State of Poverty and Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but for <hi>our ſakes became poor, that we through his poverty might become rich.</hi> The neceſſity of his Death aroſe from his own <hi>holy will,</hi> his free Act and Undertaking; which doth not leſſen his <hi>Willingneſs,</hi> but heighten the Obligation of it. It had been <hi>Injustice</hi> to puniſh <hi>an Innocent,</hi> who was <hi>unwilling</hi> to ſuffer in the place of <hi>a Criminal;</hi> But he gave himſelf a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a ſweet ſmelling Odour unto God for us. He was not driven by force and violence, as the legal Sacrifices unto the
<pb facs="tcp:44317:44"/> Altar; But, <hi>he comes to the Door of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,</hi> he enters into this <hi>Garden</hi> that <hi>Judas</hi> knew of. He endeavours not to go out of the way, to eſcape their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but <hi>chuſes</hi> a place that the <hi>Traytor</hi> was acquainted with. He had a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to be Baptized with, and he long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for its Accompliſhment. He walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth of his <hi>own Accord,</hi> over <hi>the Brook Cedron,</hi> with his Diſciples, into <hi>this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> where <hi>he knew</hi> he ſhould be taken: And when they came to take him, he permits <hi>Judas to kiſs him,</hi> which was the ſign he had given them to diſtinguiſh the Perſon; He twice tells the Officers, That <hi>he was He whom they ſought for.</hi> He would not ſuffer an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to uſe a Sword in his Defence, though he <hi>could have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Legions of Angels for his Guard.</hi> He proves, that he might have eſcaped if he would, for he ſpeaks but a mild word, ſaying, <hi>I am he,</hi> and they <hi>all fall to the ground,</hi> as if he had come to <hi>apprehend them,</hi> and not <hi>they him.</hi> After this, he would not <hi>work a Miracle</hi> to gratifie the Curioſity of <hi>Herod,</hi> and make him his Friend, in order to his Deliverance. Yea, he was <hi>ſilent</hi> under all the Accuſations of the Falſe Witneſſes, and afterward <hi>bore his own Croſs,</hi> as far as he was able, towards the place of Execution; And
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44317:44"/> then he poured out his Soul unto <hi>Death,</hi> and rendred up his Spirit to his Father, ſaying, <hi>It is finiſhed, It is finiſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that laſt Circumſtance is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable to prove his <hi>Willingneſs:</hi> For we read, that <hi>when they came to break his bones, and found him dead,</hi> which prevented the breaking of his Bones, and accompliſhed the Prophecy concerning him, which ſays, <hi>A bone of him ſhall not be broken,</hi> they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered he was dead ſo quickly; <hi>So quickly</hi> indeed, when immediately before he gave up the Ghoſt, <hi>he cried with a loud Voice;</hi> Which ſufficiently declared, that no man took away his Life, but that he voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid it down: For having cryed with <hi>a loud Voice,</hi> and thereby given ſufficient Proof, that his ſtrength was not gone, that his Spirits were not exhauſted, but he might have continued longer alive; he then <hi>bowed his head,</hi> in token of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his Father, <hi>and gave up the Ghoſt:</hi> which was a Circumſtance ſo conſiderable, that a <hi>Centurion,</hi> who ſtood by obſerving it, was thereupon <hi>converted,</hi> and gave God the Glory.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected, though his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into <hi>this Garden</hi> might be a Proof of his Willingneſs, yet what paſſed <hi>there,</hi> ſeems to intimate the contrary; why elſe does he pray ſo earneſtly, <hi>that the Cup
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44317:45"/> might paſs from him,</hi> if he was willing to drink it?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That even in the Time of his Agony, when he ſeemed moſt Unwilling, <hi>as Man,</hi> even when he prayed, that the Cup might paſs from him, yet was he ſtill willing, <hi>as Mediator.</hi> The Text ſays, he <hi>began to be exceeding ſorrowful, and ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, ſaying, My Soul is exceeding ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, even unto death.</hi> The Original words are very emphatical, to expreſs Sadneſs, and Fear, and ſuch Affections of the <hi>Soul; His Soul,</hi> not <hi>his Body;</hi> nor his <hi>Soul</hi> with Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy only with his Body: For he was here <hi>alone</hi> in the Garden, crucified, as it were, without a Croſs. <hi>His Body</hi> here ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by reaſon of <hi>his Soul.</hi> The whole Nature of Man had ſinned, and the <hi>Soul</hi> being the Principal in the commiſſion of Sin, the Redeemer, who was to expiate ſin, ſuffered in <hi>his Soul; My Soul is exceeding ſorrowful, even to death;</hi> Inſomuch that Clods of Blood dropt from him, though there was no viſible hand to ſtrike him: Which makes him pray and cry in ſuch a manner to his Father for the paſſing away of the Cup, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me? Father, ſave me from this hour!</hi> Oh what Pain, what Fear, what Horror, what diſmal Apprehenſions, and cruel Sufferings, muſt force ſuch words of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44317:45"/> complaint from ſuch an Heart as his! But, no wonder his Cries were ſo ſtrong, his Prayers ſo earneſt, his Complaints ſo loud, and the Comfort of an Angel not ſufficient for his ſupport; when the greatneſs of his <hi>Agony,</hi> and the extream <hi>Sufferings of his Soul</hi> are above <hi>our thoughts</hi> to conceive, who underſtand ſo little of the evil of ſin, and the vengeance due to it, ſo little of the <hi>Terror of the Lord,</hi> and the Power of his Wrath as a Righteous Avenger.</p>
            <p>However there is <hi>a great difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what Chriſt ſuffered, and what <hi>the Damned in Hell</hi> ſuffer. For they hate God, and Holineſs, and are hated of him, and forſaken by his Holy Spirit, and are under the power of ſin, and are tormented by the Conſcience of their Perſonal Guilt. But what Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd was for us, and he was ſtill in the Love of God, and continued to love him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us conſider him incompaſſed with Grief, and ſeized by ſorrow, appaled with Fear, lying proſtrate on his Face on the ground, deprecating that Cup of vengeance, which the Juſtice of God had mingled, ſaying, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible let this Cup paſs from me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He Prays <hi>again,</hi> a ſecond time, in the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44317:46"/> ſame place, to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Abba Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs.</hi> He adores his Majeſty, he owns his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, he takes hold of his Power, he pleads his filial Relation, with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable earneſtneſs, ſubmiſſion, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, and with thee all things are poſſible: Abba Father, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, let this Cup paſs from me;</hi> And then he groans, and ſweats, and his ſweat was as it were <hi>great drops of blood falling to the ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He prays again, <hi>the third time,</hi> uſing, in effect, the ſame words; as if nothing elſe would, yet <hi>his Importunity</hi> might, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail for the removal of the Cup. And yet notwithſtanding all this, he was then <hi>Willing;</hi> All the ſtruglings of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Nature iſſued in this, That the Will of God ſhould be done, and his Glory be accompliſhed. <hi>Holy Father, glorifie thy ſelf; Not my will but thine be done. It was for this end I came into the World, for this end I came unto this hour.</hi> The deſire of his Humane Soul ſubmits, and yields to the determination, and Will of his Father. And therefore thoſe words, <hi>if it be poſſible,</hi> muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by thoſe other, <hi>If thou wilt,</hi> if it be moſt for thy Glory; of a poſſibility in reſpect of the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:44317:46"/> rather than of the <hi>Divine Power.</hi> And having <hi>two Natures,</hi> he muſt needs have <hi>two Wills,</hi> he could not elſe be the true <hi>Son of God,</hi> and <hi>true Man.</hi> He deſires to decline his Sufferings <hi>as a Man,</hi> for ſo they were againſt Nature; But as they were the means, to reconcile us to God, he is willing, <hi>as Redeemer,</hi> to undergo them. We may abhor a Medicine as bitter, and yet reſolve to take it as whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.

And it is moſt probable, that the People in the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> were to keep from the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> at the diſtance of <hi>two thouſand Cubits;</hi> And, on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, this diſtance is ſuppoſed the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>a Sabbath-days Journey,</hi> when they went to the Ark to Worſhip. It is an ordinary Tradition among the <hi>Jews,</hi> That it was not lawful on their Sabbaths to walk above two thouſand cubits, which ſeems to be founded on that Text, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 3.4. where the People are commanded in their March after the Ark, and on either ſide of it, to <hi>keep at the diſtance of two thouſand cubits;</hi> and when they encamped, did uſually pitch their Tents at that diſtance from the <hi>Ark:</hi> And ſo the Cuſtom aroſe of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling but 2000 cubits on their Sabbath-days, which is reckon'd <hi>not above half a mile.</hi> It may be, for this reaſon, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> meaſures the diſtance between <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the <hi>Mount of Olives,</hi> by a <hi>Sabbath-days Journey,</hi> and not by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Furlongs; Becauſe, in fair Weather, many devout <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to retire thither for Meditation, after the Publick Worſhip was over. From hence let me make two Reflections for our own practice, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:44317:47"/>1. Since our Lord was wont to retire from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the <hi>Mount of Olives</hi> for <hi>Meditation</hi> and <hi>Prayer;</hi> Let me hence take occaſion to preſs theſe Duties. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly one of the beſt Evidences of an Upright Chriſtian, to be ſerious in this ſecret work. It is of mighty advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to our growth in Grace, to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and Comfort of it; And he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not the Name of a Serious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, who can paſs whole days and weeks contentedly without Meditation and ſecret Prayer. Our ſtedfaſtneſs in the ways of God, and our daily walk in holy Security and Peace, is manifeſtly aſſiſted by it. Such a courſe cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with regarding and indulging deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately any known ſin. This will be a good Argument of our Integrity before God, this conſtant intercourſe and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion between God and us; Theſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent viſits to Heaven will be ſo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with God, and pouring out our hearts before him in Secret, retiring, as it were, to the other World, ſo as no temptation of Applauſe, or Reputation from Men, can be thought to byaſs or miſlead us; when no eye ſees us, but the great ſearcher of hearts; when no ear hears us but that of our Inviſible Judge;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44317:48"/> when no hand can reward us, but the Omnipreſent Lord, our Father and our Redeemer in Heaven, who <hi>ſees in ſecret, and will reward us openly.</hi> You have been often told, That <hi>the Conſcientious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Secret prayer, will make you leave ſinning,</hi> or <hi>a Courſe of ſin will make you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt daily ſerious praying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I infer from this example of our Lord, That <hi>after the participation of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Odinances,</hi> eſpecially on the Lord's-day, <hi>it is very fit and uſeful for Chriſtians, to retire by themſelves, to ſpend ſome time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, in Meditation and prayer;</hi> To call your ſelves to an Account, to reflect on your wayes, and frame, to make a trial of your State, and Temper; to obſerve your Spirits, how they have been influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, or not, by the Divine Spirit, in the Solemn Duties of Worſhip; to <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> your ſelves before God for the ſins you are convinced of, ſuch eſpecially as other Men cannot charge you with, but <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> know you are <hi>guilty</hi> of: To thank God for his numberleſs Mercies, to beg the ſuitable ſupplies of his Grace, and whatever Bleſſings you ſtand in need of, for you and yours. This is the right improvement of <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and ſuch ſeaſons
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44317:48"/> of Mercy, as God is pleaſed to continue to us, in order to Eternal Life: And without ſomething of this kind, tho you frequent the Publick Aſſemblies, <hi>and ſit before him as his People,</hi> you do but mock God, and trifle with Heaven, while you pretend to Religion, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Name of <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> You act a Scene, and a Part, and <hi>have only a Form of Godlineſs,</hi> but muſt expect to pay dear for your Solemn Hopocriſie.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore Adviſe you to <hi>three things,</hi> in your Retirement, after the Publick Worſhip, and Solemn Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt, as <hi>the End,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> for which I will preſs it. 1, That you retire in order to <hi>the confeſſion of Sin,</hi> and the Exerciſe of <hi>Repentance.</hi> That when you have finiſhed the publick work of a Sabbath, or come from any ſpecial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the Goſpel, by after Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you would reflect upon your ſelves, and take notice of your Defects, and Failings, Diſcompoſures, and Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Mind; What unſuitableneſs of Spirit there has been to heavenly Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or what unprepared Addreſſes we have made to the Majeſty of Heaven and Earth, the roving of our Fancies, the vanity of our Thoughts &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="80" facs="tcp:44317:49"/>
            <p>We ſhould humble our ſelves on ſuch Occaſions, That we attended with no more Reverence and Diligence to the Word of God; That we did not receive the <hi>Truth</hi> in the Love of it; That it was not mixed with Faith; Tnat we did not make particular, and cloſe application of it to our ſelves; That our Hearts were not l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ft up in the ways of the Lord, and our Souls under an awe of God in Prayer, with becoming Affections, and ſuitable Exerciſe of Grace, under the influence of the Divine Spirit, and in the Name of the Mediator. That we approached the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Lord,</hi> with no more Examination of our Hearts and Ways, before we came, with no more Repentance for our paſt Guilt, no more hungering after the Bread of Life, no more ſpiritual Thirſt for the Fountain of Living Waters. That we beheld the <hi>Memorials of a broken, bleeding Saviour,</hi> with no more Contrition, and Brokenneſs of Heart; That we received the Seals of his dying Love with no more raiſed Affection; That we remembered the Agonies of his Soul, with no more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent Impreſſions upon our own. In a word, we may lament (for the moſt part I fear we may) after ſuch Ordinances, that our Spirits were but in a common frame, our Repentance ſo partial, our Love ſo
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44317:49"/> cold, our Faith ſo weak, our Hope ſo low. Deſires ſo faint, Charity ſo narrow, Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Joy ſo little, in the Participari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch Glorious Myſteries, in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with ſuch adorable Objects, under the Offers of ſuch rich Grace, under the loud Calls to ſuch manifeſt Duty, under the Aſſurances and Expectations of ſuch great and bleſſed things, as the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments propoſe and Seal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Reaſon, and Ground of this Retirement, is in order to <hi>Petition</hi> and <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> for needful Mercy to our ſelves and others. Have we been convinced of any Duty we had formerly neglected? Shall not the Reflection on it excite us to beg Wiſdom and Strength to perform that Duty? Has any ſin been called to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, by the preaching of the Word? Should we not beg Forgiveneſs, and Grace to leave and forſake it, as the beſt Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Repentance? Have we joyned in Prayer and Supplication with others for the greateſt Bleſſings, and are ſenſible we are undone if God deny us; and ſhall we not beg the ſame things again in ſecret? Have we renewed our Vows, and entered into freſh Obligations to be the Lords; and ſhall w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>O my gracious God, thou haſt ſurpast all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Comprehenſion in thy Love!

I ſee now thy thoughts are above our thoughts and thy ways above our ways, and thy Love above the Love of man, even more then the Heavens are above the Earth: with</hi> how dear a Price <hi>haſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd</hi> a Wretch <hi>that deſerves thy Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Vengeance! With how precious and ſweet</hi> a Feaſt <hi>haſt thou entertain'd me, who deſerved to be caſt out with the workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity! ſhall I evermore ſlight ſuch Love as this? ſhall it not evercome my Rebelliouſneſs, and melt my cold and hardn'd heart?</hi> Angels <hi>are admiring theſe Miracles of Love and ſhall not I admire them?</hi> Their Love <hi>to us doth cauſe 'em to</hi> Rejoyce, <hi>while they stand by, and ſee our Heavenly Feaſt; and ſhould it not be ſweeter</hi> to us <hi>that are</hi> the Gueſts <hi>who feed upon it?</hi> O my God, <hi>how dearly haſt thou Purchaſed my Love! how ſtrangely haſt thou deſerv'd and Sought it? nothing is ſo much my grief and ſhame as that I can anſwer it with no more fervent and fruitful Love. Oh what an addition would it be to all this precious Mercy, if</hi> this Love <hi>poured out might draw forth</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:44317:52"/> mine, <hi>and my ſoul might flame by approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto theſe thy flames? and that Love drawn out by the ſenſe of Love might be all my Life?

And now thou haſt choſen ſo low a dwelling, O be not a stranger to the heart thou hast ſo freely choſen! O make it the daily Reſidence of thy Spirit! Quicken it by thy Grace, adorn it with thy Gifts, employ it in thy love, refreſh it with thy joys, and the light of thy Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? and deſtroy this Carnality, ſelfiſhneſs, and unbelief! and let the world ſee, that God will make a Palace of the loweſt Heart, when he chuſeth it for the place of his own abode.</hi>

            <p>To conclude, Did we thus retire at the cloſe of every Lords day, after the Participation of ſolemn Ordinances, to renew our Repentance, to beg needful Mercies, to offer the ſacrifices of Praiſe and Thankſgivings, for the Bleſſings we have and hope for; the Advantages of ſuch a Courſe would be ſo many, and ſo conſiderable; the Conſequences would be ſo comfortable to our own Souls, and ſo beneficial unto others; it would be ſo influential to exerciſe, and increaſe our Grace, to promote our

Lightfoot.</note> of the Jews, as to thoſe who did officiate in the Temple, who after having been purified and Waſhed in the morning, as often as they came out, and returned againe, did only waſh <hi>their Feet.</hi> Doubtleſs therefore the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of inward Purification and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt be comprehended, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this waſhing: The being ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Soul, Body and Spirit, as neceſſary unto all that are accepted of God, and in a Covenant Relation with Chriſt: neceſſary to a ſaving intreſt in Him, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44317:55"/> Communion with him. And ſuch a Change as this ſome of the vileſt, and worſt of ſinners have experienced, upon true Repentance and an unfeined Faith. This the words I have read give us an account of. <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning of this Chapter, the Apoſtle reproves a very unwarrantable Practice among theſe Corinthians, to implead one another in matters of Right and Wrong, before the Heathen Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals: which ſeems to blemiſh the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Profeſſion, and contradicted the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Rule of our Lord. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15. they were alſo Injurious, and Unjuſt in their Carriage to their Brethren: from which he Indeavours to deter them. 1. By that dreadful threatning, vers. 9. <hi>Know you not, that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> And for the farther confirmation of it, enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates ſeveral kinds of ſuch Perſons; and bids them look well to it, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves (tho' one would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think that men ſhould be deceived in ſo plain a caſe) as if their profeſſion of Chriſtianity would ſave them, while they lived in any ſuch wickedneſs. <hi>Be not deceived neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers in any,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:44317:55"/>
            <p>He then adds another argument in this Text, to diſwade them from ſuch an unchriſtian Behaviour, <hi>viz.</hi> from the mighty Change, that had been wrought upon ſeveral of them, by their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Faith of Chriſt. <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you but ye are Waſhed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Change</hi> is repreſented by three ſeveral expreſſions: and the <hi>Means</hi> by which it was brought about is double viz. <hi>In the name of our Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The mighty <hi>Change</hi> which was wrought upon them by their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Faith of Chriſt, in thoſe words, But ye are <hi>Waſhed,</hi> but ye are <hi>Sanctified,</hi> but ye are <hi>Justified;</hi> ſome would conſider theſe three expreſſions, as a regular Gradation, and make this <hi>Waſhing</hi> to ſignifie the firſt Change by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or the new Birth: and being <hi>Sanctified,</hi> to denote the further progreſs, meaſure and Degree of the ſpirit of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: and being <hi>Juſtified</hi> follows, as that, which by a real change of Heart and Life is evidenced, and cleared, to the comfort of Believers. Others think we may conſider this being <hi>Waſhed</hi> as the general Term comprehending the other two, <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Juſtification.</hi> For we find that expreſſion uſed in both
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44317:56"/> ſenſes: for our deliverance from the Guilt of ſin, by pardoning mercy; and from the impurity and ſtain, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and filth of ſin by renewing grace. David beggs to be <hi>Waſhed</hi> and made <hi>Clean</hi> in both reſpects 51. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.7.10. And our Lord is ſaid to have loved us, <hi>and waſhed us from our ſins,</hi> in his owne blood! <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. Which comprehends both the forgiveneſs of ſin, and the ſanctifying influence of the ſpirit of Chriſt. Others think all the three terms <hi>Waſhed, Sanctified,</hi> and <hi>Juſtified,</hi> are here Synanimous: as ſignificant of the great Change, that is wrought by the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and converting grace of God; and that <hi>Juſtified</hi> in this place is not to be taken in a<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Le</hi> Blank, <hi>Theſes theol. de uſu &amp; acceptatione vocis Juſtificandi &amp;c. p.</hi> 256. §. 6.8.9.

            </p>
            <p>So Sanctification they think may be comprehended under the term <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> Rom. 8.30. Or elſe one of the greateſt Advantages we enjoy by Chriſt is not there enumerated. So here where
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44317:56"/> our <hi>Juſtification</hi> is aſcribed to, <hi>the holy Spirit,</hi> whoſe office and work it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to renew and change us: and whereby thoſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who were vile and impure before, are now quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the Kingdom of God, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.6.1. However I exclude not our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>waſhed</hi> from the <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> as part of the <hi>Senſe</hi> of this <hi>Text;</hi> but it is the other Waſhing by <hi>Sanctification,</hi> of which I would ſpeak at this time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You have the double means, whereby this is brought about. <hi>In the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God,</hi> &amp;c. 1. <hi>In the Name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> or <hi>by,</hi> and <hi>through the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as the <hi>Greek Particle</hi> doth often ſignifie. For it is the ſame in the <hi>Original,</hi> in both Clauſes. The firſt may as well be rendered, <hi>By the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>By the Spirit of our God.</hi> The ſame Prepoſition being <hi>uſed in both.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the whole to <hi>Sanctification.</hi> In my preſent Diſcourſe I ſhall not need to Aſſign Reaſons, why the word <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified</hi> is put laſt, or ſearch for the like Inſtances of an <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, tho ſuch may be given, to vindicate the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Expreſſions; and why <hi>the Name of Chriſt,</hi> which eſpecially refers to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44317:57"/> 
               <hi>Juſtification,</hi> ſhould be mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the Spirit of our God,</hi> which eſpecially refers to <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which yet is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before our being <hi>Juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>by his Name,</hi> may import, in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>for the ſake of Chriſt,</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Merit, and Mediation: and ſo <hi>we pray in the Name of Christ,</hi> and beg Mercy for his ſake. But more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, <hi>the Name of Chriſt</hi> may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In relation to his Office of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and the Soveraign Authority of it: he is <hi>the Jeſus, the Saviour;</hi> this is <hi>the Name, that is given him above every Name,</hi> and ſo <hi>in, by,</hi> or <hi>through</hi> the Name of Chriſt, does ſignifie, <hi>through faith in him,</hi> as the only Mediator between God and Man. In ſeveral like Expreſſions we muſt grant that <hi>Faith</hi> muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, when it is not expreſſed: As when we are ſaid to be <hi>Baptiz'd in the Name of Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſin,</hi> Acts 2.38. <hi>i. e.</hi> believing on his Name.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may be conſidered in relation to the Truth of his Doctrine, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of that Revelation, which he made from God to the World,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44317:57"/> upon which his Name is engraven: As when we read of ſuffering <hi>for the Name of Chriſt,</hi> i. e. for owning the profeſſion of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> To this purpoſe our <hi>Sanctification</hi> is ſaid to be by <hi>the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Truth, John</hi> 15.3.17. <hi>chap.</hi> 17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Ye are clean through the word that I have ſpoken to you,</hi> ſayes our bleſſed Lord. And in his <hi>Mediatory Prayer</hi> to the Father, <hi>Sanctifie them by thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi> According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we find Sanctification is aſcribed unto <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> as the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or a ſound Belief of the Revelation he hath made, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Purifying the heart by Faith.</hi> So that we are waſhed, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, through the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, or <hi>by Chriſt known, and belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on,</hi> as <hi>one means</hi> of it, and by the Efficiency of the Spirit of God, as <hi>the other;</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch I ſhall afterwards ſpeak of. <hi>In the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>diſcourſing</hi> of theſe words I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Give ſome brief account of the Nature of this Change, here expreſt by being <hi>Waſhed, Sanctified</hi> and <hi>Justified. Secondly,</hi> Of the two great <hi>Means,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is brought about, <hi>the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and the Spirit of our God. Thirdly,</hi> Make ſome Improvement, by
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44317:58"/> Application: eſpecially to aſſiſt you, in examining your ſelves, in order to <hi>the Lord's Table;</hi> that we may know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are in the number of ſuch, upon whom this Change is paſſed. Whether we are <hi>Waſhed, Sanctified,</hi> and <hi>Juſtified,</hi> in the <hi>Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the nature of this <hi>Change.</hi> It is evident, that the defiling nature of Sin is here ſuppoſed: there could not otherwiſe be any need of <hi>Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> And we find it repreſented in Scripture by <hi>Spots,</hi> and <hi>Blemiſhes,</hi> by <hi>Mire</hi> and <hi>Vomit</hi> by the <hi>Blood and Pollution</hi> of a <hi>New-born Child,</hi> by the moſt <hi>filthy dung</hi> and <hi>Excrements,</hi> and whatſoever is reckoned the <hi>moſt vile</hi> and <hi>abominable.</hi> Therefore whatſoever <hi>Excellencies</hi> and <hi>Ornaments,</hi> whatſoever <hi>Priviledges</hi> and <hi>Advantages,</hi> an Unſanctified Perſon may partake of, to recommend him to the eyes of the World, he is yet a <hi>Vile Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> loathed and abominable in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, that by Nature we are All as an Unclean thing. <hi>That which is born of the Fleſh, is Fleſh;</hi> and, <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean,</hi> John
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44317:58"/> 3.6. Rom. 3.10. Job 14.4. All the <hi>Purifications</hi> and <hi>Waſhings</hi> under the Law, did ſuppoſe our inward Defilement, and repreſent our need of Cleanſing.</p>
            <p>Whatever was injoyned by the <hi>Moſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Inſtitution</hi> of this kind (which we find was very ſtrictly charged, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly preſt, and indiſpenſably required, and the neglect of it moſt ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed:) yet did but ſignifie and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this. Which proves our Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neceſſary, Tit. 3.5. <hi>He ſaved us by the waſhing of Regeneration, and by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> All Men are Defiled, and Unclean by Nature, and need to be <hi>Waſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We are all over Unclean, from the Crown of the Head, to the Sole of the Foot; Univerſally diſeaſed and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, and ſo need to be Sanctified in Soul, Body, and Spirit, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Iſa</hi> 1.6. we read of the <hi>filthineſs of the Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> from which we are to be cleanſed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. All the Powers of the Soul, and all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body are tainted; Heart and Hand muſt be Cleanſed; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward Man Sanctified. <hi>Cleanſe your hands ye ſinners, and purifie your hearts ye double minded,</hi> Jam. 4 8.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:44317:59"/>4. The Change therefore by Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, muſt be Univerſal, <hi>in heart and life.</hi> By the knowledge of God, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to him (of whom we were Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and to whom before we were Diſaffected) by the Image of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; by participation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, and Life; by the Law of God written on the Heart, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Converſation. Holineſs and Love to God muſt be the frame and temper of our Souls; ſo that the Actings of it become eaſie, pleaſant, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. <hi>The Old Man muſt be put off, the New put on Old things be done away, and all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new.</hi> New Principles, new Ends, new Motives, new Rules, new Comforts, which will make an unſpeakable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between this Change, and that Negative Religion, and common Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, which many may pretend to, who are ſtrangers to Regeneration. There were many <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Sophiſts</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who boaſted of Purity and Reformation, which came unexpreſſibly ſhort of this <hi>Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> which I am now ſpeaking of, as ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome other cauſe than the Spirit of Chriſt, unto whom the production, continuance, and progreſs of this Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is alone to be aſcribed.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb facs="tcp:44317:59"/>5. It may farther be conſidered in its Begining, or Progreſs, or Conſummati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As begun by the Spirit of Life and Power from Chriſt; as maintained and carried on, by a continual influence from the ſame Spirit and the diligent uſe of God's appointed means. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Lineaments of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are rendred more clear, holy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions more powerful, and efficacious; Whereby we go from ſtrength to ſtrength, and are inabled to <hi>perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the fear of God; preſſing on towards perfection, to the fulneſs of the ſtature of the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> till it be conſummate in Heaven: when, by ſeeing Chriſt <hi>as he is,</hi> we ſhall be made like him, and be preſented to the Father <hi>without ſpot or wrinkle,</hi> or any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For the ſake of thoſe who intend to come to <hi>the Lord's Table,</hi> let me add, That ſuch Waſhing and Sanctification is requiſite to our Communion with Chriſt in the ſpecial Ordinances of the Goſpel, particularly that of <hi>the Lord's Supper.</hi> This is intimated by our Lord in the 13th of <hi>John, v.</hi> 7, 8. in his words to <hi>Peter, If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part with me.</hi> It muſt have a Spiritual
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44317:60"/> meaning, becauſe notwithſtanding the external Waſhing, Chriſt ſays, <hi>All of them were not clean.</hi> And ſoon after this, he inſtituted his Supper, to the due participation whereof, it is neceſſary we be Waſhed and Sanctified. For we cannot otherwiſe have a Right to the Benefits purchaſed by his Blood, which are Sealed to us in that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and we can have no Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him there, till partakers of the Spirit of Chriſt. Unleſs we are Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by that Spirit, we have no intereſt in him, no Right to his Supper, and ſo we can have no Communion with him: if we are not cleanſed from our Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if we have ſpots upon us that are not the ſpots of God's Children, unto whom this Feaſt doth particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. And therefore I may ſay, as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus, Thou haſt neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not right with God,</hi> neither can it be, if this Change do not precede. The Enquiry therefore is highly ſeaſonable, whether we are thus Waſhed, and Sanctified, or not? But before I give the <hi>Characters</hi> of ſuch Perſons, it will be expected, I ſhould ſpeak ſomewhat concerning the double means of this Change, <hi>In the Name of our Lord Jeſus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:44317:60"/>II. The double <hi>Means</hi> of this Change, by the Name of <hi>the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> We are Purified, and Waſhed, <hi>By the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or by <hi>Faith in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpoſe, Conſider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> That all the Arguments laid down in Scripture, to preſs Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Holineſs of Heart and Life, have influence and force according to our <hi>Faith.</hi> The Arguments from God, from Chriſt, from our ſelves, from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, from the Example and Life of Chriſt, from his redeeming Grace, and dying Love, from his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Promiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They all depend upon our <hi>Faith;</hi> and have no force, or power, any further than we believe in Chriſt, and heartily embrace the Goſpel-Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> It is <hi>by the Name of Chriſt,</hi> or by Faith in him, that we are Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe in order to our Sanctification, Chriſt is to be eyed, and improved ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wayes.</p>
            <pb n="104" facs="tcp:44317:61"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> The Blood of Chriſt muſt be eyed in order to our Sanctification. Our Faith muſt be employed upon a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saviour. As his Blood is able to cleanſe us from all ſins. <hi>Who loved us and waſhed us from our ſins, in his own Blood; Who gave himſelf for us that he might ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and cleanſe us, by the waſhing of Water by the Word,</hi> Rev. 1.5. Epheſ. 5.25. For, as the Apoſtle argues, from the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of Ceremonial Uncleanneſs by the Legal Purifications; <hi>If the Blood of Bulls and Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer, ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the unclean, availed to the purifying of the Fleſh, how much more ſhall the Blood of Chriſt, who by the Eternal Spirit offered up himſelf to God, purge our Conſciences from dead Works,</hi> Heb. 9.13. Accordingly we find, <hi>The Sanctification of the Spirit,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with <hi>the ſprinkling of the Blood of Jeſus,</hi> or, as the <hi>purchaſe</hi> of his <hi>Blood,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> Faith makes uſe of the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> of Chriſt, and his Prayer in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for this Effect. The whole fruit of the Death of Chriſt, whereof the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Spirit is one Principal part, is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out by the Father upon the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Chriſt. What he merited on the Croſs by his great Sacrifice, he prays
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44317:61"/> in Heaven may be applyed to Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Souls, as the fruit of it: and upon the account of the everlaſting value of his Death, his Interceſſion founded on it, is always Prevalent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> His Promiſe and Covenant, whereby he hath engaged to cleanſe us from all <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and to ſprinkle clean Water upon us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. He hath promiſed his Blood ſhall be a <hi>Fountain open for ſin and uncleaneſs,</hi> Zach. 13.1. <hi>That Chriſt ſhall ſave us from our ſins, and be exalted to give Repentance, and to turn us from our Iniquities, and bring us back to God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Hereupon our Faith muſt eye <hi>the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> as the great Sanctifier of Souls, and the Author of all our Purity. This great Benefit, which is promiſed in the Word, purchas'd by Chriſt upon his Croſs, and beſtowed, granted, and given out upon his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, is applyed by the Efficiency of the Eternal Spirit. He Sanctifies our Hearts and Natures, and continually vouchſafes holy Influences of Light, and Life, and Power, anſwerable to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Difficulties, and Neceſſities of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Souls, in every Age and Place of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44317:62"/> the World. This brings me to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the other means of our <hi>Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> viz.</p>

Becauſe all things under the Law, were purged from their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Uncleanneſs, either by <hi>Fire,</hi> or <hi>Water.</hi> What would abide the <hi>Fire,</hi> was to be <hi>Purified by Fire:</hi> and what would not, was to be <hi>Cleanſed by Water.</hi> Numb. 3.23. And here I might conſider a Three-fold Defilement, wherewith we are chargable. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by Original Sin. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That which is contracted by Actual Sin. <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The Pollution and Defilement that cleaves to our beſt Duties. So far as we are delivered from our Pollution, as to either of theſe, The Holy Ghoſt, in the vertue of the Blood of Chriſt, is the Author of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> We may conſider the Holy Spirit, as the Author of Poſitive Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44317:62"/> and Grace in the Soul; and ſhow,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> How he convinceth us of our <hi>need of it:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he enables us to <hi>pray for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To beleive the <hi>Value</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Blood of Christ,</hi> as able to <hi>procure it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> How he makes uſe of the Word, as the ordinary means of <hi>our San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Sometimes enables us to improve <hi>Afflictions,</hi> to promote the <hi>influence</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of the Word, to this purpoſe.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the conſideration of what theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were <hi>before this Change,</hi> we learn, that ſome of the Worſt and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of ſinners may be call'd, and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and find Mercy with God: <hi>Such were ſome of you,</hi> ſuch Idolaters, ſuch Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, ſuch Extortioners, ſuch Adulterers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44317:63"/> Phyſician. The moſt unpoliſhed Stones may be framed by the Spirit, for a ſpiritual Building; a <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> a <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> may be changed and juſtified; God will hereby magnifie the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Authority of his Word,</hi> and the Power of his Spirit. He will hereby bear Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the Freeneſs of his Love, and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his Grace.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What Love and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs do we owe to Chriſt?

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Learn where to go for this <hi>Benefit</hi> even to <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> Beg to be <hi>Sanctified through the Merits of his Death,</hi> and the <hi>Influence of his Spirit;</hi> endeavour to be ſenſible of thy <hi>Filthineſs,</hi> and cry out, <hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What a <hi>Difference</hi> doth the Grace of God make upon the Hearts and Souls of Men, from what they were, and what others are. You were ſome of the moſt Abominable Sinners; <hi>but ye are waſhed:</hi> You were carnal, <hi>but you are ſpiritual;</hi> you were proud, <hi>but now are humble;</hi> you were Darkneſs, <hi>but now are Light;</hi> You were earthly and ſenſual, <hi>but now are heavenly;</hi> You did wallow in all manner of Impurities, <hi>but now are
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44317:64"/> Holy:</hi> You were ſick, <hi>but now are healed:</hi> You were defiled, <hi>but now are cleanſed:</hi> You were at Enmity with God, and Haters of him, <hi>but now you love him, and his love is ſhed abroad in your hearts:</hi> You did love and delight in Sin, and Sinners, <hi>you now diſaffect and loath it, and them; and are aſhamed to think of thoſe things, wherein you once took pleaſure. Such were ſome of you, but you are waſhed.</hi> You were careleſs and vain, and wordly as others, <hi>but are now a ſelected, choſen, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people, zealous of good works.</hi> You could before live without Prayer in your Cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets and Families, for many Weeks, <hi>but now dare not live a day without it.</hi> You were glad when the Sabbaths were over, and the Seaſons of holy Worſhip gone, <hi>but now you are as glad when they approach, and think with pleaſure before-hand that they do ſo, &amp;c.</hi> Oh the mighty Difference that the <hi>Grace of God</hi> hath made, between what you were, and what you now are: What manner of thankful Rejoycing in God, have ſuch cauſe for, as are thus <hi>waſhed?</hi> But this will lead me to the Principal Uſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly.</hi> To Examine and Enquire, whether we are in the Number of ſuch. Whether any ſuch Change of Heart
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44317:64"/> and Life, any ſuch cleanſing from the filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit, hath been experienced by us. To aſſiſt you a little to underſtand this, Conſider, <hi>First.</hi> What have you ever experienced, and known of any humbling Convictions of your owne Pollution, and Defilment by ſin? How loathſome to God ſin hath made you: How odious and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to God's Holy Eye? Have you been made to Loath and abhor your ſelves, as in duſt and aſhes, before God? trembling before his Holyneſs, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who hateth your ſins with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hatred? being covered with ſhame and Confuſion of face, to think of your owne vileneſs? That your Hearts are ſo diſaffected to him, the Author of your Being, and the Fountain of your Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: That you have ſo often affronted; and provoked him to Anger, by violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Authority: That you have Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo long as <hi>without him in the World:</hi> and would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e <hi>content</hi> to live ſuch a ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the God, that made it and you. That your corrupt Inclinations, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Holy Nature, Image, and Law, ſo long remain'd uncured: That you have gratified thoſe Inclinations ſo often, for ſo many years, &amp;c. Have you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon been heartily deſirous to be purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44317:65"/> and cleanſed, to be Sanctified, and renewed, to be delivered from the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Pollution of ſin, as well as from the Damning-Guilt of it? If you have known nothing of ſuch kind of Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, you have no reaſon to conclude that you have been Waſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> What is your <hi>practical Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> concerning <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and the Divine Image, and Life? and what <hi>Prevalency</hi> hath it with you? Do you eſteem, and yeild conformity to the Image of God? Is Holineſs accounted your Honour, your Glory, your Pleaſure, as unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably preferable to all the Riches, and Pleaſures, and Dignities of the Word? Is this your fixed Judgment? and does it put you upon the diligent uſe of Gods appointed Means, to recover this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and to be made partaker of his Holineſs? Does it make you watchful over your Hearts, and ſenſual Appetits, Paſſions, Words, and Wayes, ſo far as ordinarily to prevail againſt the Power of Worldlineſs, and ſenſuality? I do not ask, whether it keeps you from <hi>every ſin</hi> but whether it prevail ſo far, that you regard no Iniquity in your Hearts. Is there no ſecret way of Wickedneſs you Indulge, and continue in? But you loath your ſelves in the Preſence of God,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44317:65"/> and Mourn in ſecret for thoſe ſins, that none but God and Conſcience can charge you with? and carefully watch, and Walk, as believing ſin to be the greateſt Evil? Is this your Habitual Frame, and ordinary Courſe? If it be thus, you are <hi>Waſhed,</hi> and <hi>ſanctified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Examine your ſelves, from what <hi>Motives,</hi> and upon what <hi>Principles,</hi> you abſtain from thoſe Sins, you are otherwiſe inclined and tempted to. Is it from the Fear of God, and Love to him? Is it from the awe of his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? and gratitude for the Innumerable Obligations you are under by his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Grace? Is it becauſe ſin is hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diſpleaſing to God, and Chriſt, as well as becauſe of its miſerable and deſtructive Conſequences and Effects to you? Is it from an inward Ruling Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that makes the pleaſing of God your daily and delightful Work?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly.</hi> How do you ſtand Affected to the Impurities, and <hi>Sins of Other Men?</hi> Are you grieved at the Diſhonour of God, by the ſins of others. Do you pity and pray for your ſinful Neighbours, Relations, and Acquaintance? Eſpecially when they fall into the ſame ſins, that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44317:66"/> you your ſelves have formerly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and repented of. And therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour what you can to promote the Repentance, and Salvation of others, in your place and ſtation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly.</hi> How are you Affected to <hi>Heart ſins?</hi> and to the Remainders of Impurity in your own ſouls? If the Fountain be cleanſed, and the Heart purified, the inward motions of ſin will be abominable and hateful to you. Do you feel the Burden of the Body of ſin and Death, and complain of it? Do you walk humbly under the ſenſe of your remaining Pollutions? The more you are Waſhed, and the more Aſſurance you have of it, the more you will mourn for your remaining Uncleaneſs. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25.31. <hi>I will ſprinkle clean water upon them, and they ſhall be clean: I will give them new Hearts, and new Spirits, and they ſhall remember their evil wayes, and doings, and loath themſelves for all their Tranſgreſſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are you Diligent in the uſe of all Means, for further Purification of Hearts? Is it the grief of your ſouls, that there is ſo much Filth yet remaining; Do you not find, that you are not cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enough? Do you not goe to Sermons
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44317:66"/> and Sacraments, with this Deſire and Deſign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Hope, That you may be more Sanctified in Soul, Body, and Spirit. Do you not beg that all Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences may be bleſſed, and improved to that Purpoſe? Can you not thank God for ſuch Afflictions, as you hope have been ſerviceable to this end. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly.</hi> How are you affected towards <hi>the Temptations,</hi> that would inſnare you, and defile you again? He that is truly cleanſed, will take care to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Clean. If Conſcience be not tender to make you watchful, and circumſpect to avoid being defiled, it is a ſign you were ever truly waſhed. If you can make as bold with Temptation as ever, and are not afraid of entring into it, and being overcome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly.</hi> How are you Affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by whoſe Blood and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we are Sanctified and cleanſed? <hi>He lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and waſhed us from our Sins in his own Blood:</hi> And if he have applied it to you in particular, you cannot but adore, and <hi>Love him,</hi> and delight in Communion with him: Love him, and love his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age wherever you ſee it: Love him, and have the ſame Friends and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb facs="tcp:44317:67"/> with him: Love him, and prize your part in Chriſt above all things in this World. And if you love him you will watch and obſerve his Carriage and Behaviour; whether he ſmile or frown; whether he be angry or pleaſed; more than what all the World can ſay, or do, for you, or againſt you. If you are waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt, it muſt needs be ſo.</p>
               <p>And the ſenſe of his redeeming Love, and pardoning mercy, and Sanctifying Grace, will ſo raiſe your Love to him, as to increaſe your hatred and deteſtation of ſin. <hi>You will remember, and be confounded, and melted, and aſhamed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and humbled for ſin</hi> by the ſenſe of his being <hi>pacified</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you, and having waſhed you in his Blood; For ſo is the Promiſe, 16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 63. <hi>That thou mayeſt Remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou haſt done, ſayth the Lord God.</hi> The experience of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans confirms it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eightly.</hi> How do you ſtand Affected as to your <hi>Company.</hi> Waſhed Perſons will delight in clean Company. They that are the ſheep of Chriſt, waſhed in the Blood of Jeſus, cannot take delight in the Company of Swine. Nothing but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44317:67"/> or the deſign and hope of doing them good, will bring you into ſuch Company. You will not chooſe it, and take pleaſure in it, as formerly; or make ſuch your Familiars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly.</hi> I might add, that ſuch will long for the <hi>Perfection of Holineſs;</hi> when they ſhall be perfectly cleanſed and purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſin. It will be their dayly work to purifie themſelves, as Chriſt is pure, by the hope of ſeeing him as he is, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. the thoughts of <hi>Heaven,</hi> as a ſtate of <hi>Perfect Purity,</hi> in conformity to the Image of Chriſt, will be very delightful: and <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf, as the way to it, will loſe it terrors, and become deſireable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly.</hi> The next uſe I would make, ſhall be for the <hi>Encouragement of repenting Sinners,</hi> and <hi>returning Backſliders.</hi> How vile ſoever they have been, through Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance toward God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus, they may yet be waſhed, Sanctified and Juſtified. If you are under a ſerious Conviction of your Guilt, and Filthineſs; and ready to crie out <hi>O God, I am aſhamed and bluſh to look up becauſe of my Iniquities,</hi> or with the Prophet, <hi>We lie down in our ſhame,</hi> and <hi>our confuſion cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, for we have ſinned againſt the Lord.</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:44317:68"/> Jer. 3.5. Yet turn to the Lord, and he can Heal, and Cleanſe, and Pardon, and Sanctifie. Tho your ſins be as Crimſon, or Scarlet, they ſhall be as Snow and Wool. The Blood of Jeſus can cleanſe from all ſin. That Fountain is yet open. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs and Sanctification may yet be had. He is willing to receive and accept you if you are but heartily willing to forſake you ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and turn to him, <hi>Who is like unto our God, that pardoneth iniquity,</hi> and <hi>paſſeth by the tranſgreſſions of his heritage, Mich</hi> 7.18.</p>
               <p>Object. I. <hi>But ſome of you. may be ready to reply, I have broken my Vows. and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly backſliden from God, after I had returned to him: I have defiled my Garments, after having been waſhed: I have turned with the Dog to his vomit, and with the ſow, that is waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire: Surely God will never be reconciled to me, or gracious to me more. I have known ſomewhat of the truth of Chriſt, and taſted of the good Word of God, and had ſome experience of holy Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the pleaſure of it. and gave up my ſelf again and again to the Lord, at his own Table; and yet I have revolted from him ſince. My Conſcience flies in my face; I durst not goe to God, as formerly: He may Juſtly upbraid me, and ſay, what Iniquity did you
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44317:68"/> find in me, that you have left me? Was I a barren Wilderneſs, or a Land of Drought? That you thus forſook me: Was I an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovely God, that you could not like me? Was my Arm ſhortned, that I could not help you? or have I ever failed my word, that you might not truſt me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>How then ſhall I look him in the Face, after ſuch Apoſtacy? How ſhall I ever hope to be waſhed again, that have ſo defiled my ſelf, after having been waſhed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But have you not an expreſs <hi>Call,</hi> and <hi>Promiſe</hi> from God to encourage you to Return? <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22. A Promiſe worth Millions of Gold and Silver. <hi>Turn unto me ye backſliding Children, and I will heal your backſlidings.</hi> Do but turn, and I will help you. He calls you <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and you muſt call him <hi>Father,</hi> as you can; and not turn your backs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, v. 19. <hi>I ſaid,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Thou ſhalt call me, my Father, and ſhalt not turn away from me, even though I ſaid, for thy backſlidings, How ſhall I put thee among the Children?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>But you will ſay, I have wounded my</hi> Faith, <hi>as well as my Conſcience: I read a Promiſe, but it yields me no Comfort. I hear of the Fatherly Mercies of God, but I
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44317:69"/> cannot apply them; for I have forſaken God, and he may juſtly forſake me. My Heart miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives me, I cannot go to him as to a Father. I queſtion whether ever I was a Child or no: I fear my ſpots are not the ſpots of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But conſider this: If thou be <hi>a Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Backſlider,</hi> God can ſee the truth of thy Grace, when thou canſt not diſcern the truth of his Love. Thy Father ſeeth and knoweth thy Heart; and if thou truly Repent, and Return, he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thee. He can behold a Child through a Backſlider. When thou canſt not look up to him, as to a Father, there is yet ground enough for thee to Return, that he may <hi>heal thy Backſlidings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. III. <hi>But I have little hope, that ſuch</hi> a Treacherous Backſliding Heart, <hi>as mine, ſhould ever be healed. If I ſhould be waſhed now, I ſhall again defile my ſelf. If I ſhould once more be received to mercy, I ſhould backſlide again: And as good never come, as to come to no purpoſe. If I return to him, and continue not with him, it will but be the worſe in the latter end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If God undertake the Cure, he can purge away thy Iniquities, as well
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44317:69"/> as forgive them. Deſtroy the power of ſin, as well as remove the Guilt. He can <hi>heal thy Backſlidings,</hi> in the Root, and Cauſe, and Principle of them; ſo as thou ſhalt not turn aſide from him, as formerly. He can eſtabliſh, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en thy Heart, and give thee more ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs, and he calls thee to Turn, in order to it. Therefore <hi>turn to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. IV. <hi>O But I am never healed,</hi> till I Return, <hi>I muſt die of my wounds. I ſhall periſh in my filthineſs, if I am never waſhed, till I come, as I ought, to the fountain opened. For my Heart is hard and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; I feel it ſo. I have not ſuch an heart to turn to God as I ſhould: It is the grief of my ſoul that I find it thus. I am without ſtrength, and unable to turn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                     <hi>A Returning Backſlider</hi> may ſay, he is <hi>A Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſtill; and the Love of <hi>a Father</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable;

Though his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Juſtice may Correct me with a Rod, he will not take away his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Kindneſs utterly from me. <hi>I will,</hi> therefore, <hi>go to my Father;</hi> though he frown upon me, though he chaſtiſe me, though he threaten to turn me out of doors; <hi>I will yet Return and go to my Father,</hi> for I muſt be there. I will dye in his Arms, or I will dye at his feet; I will Return.</q> But,</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> But it will be ſaid, thy Work is great and difficult, before ever thy Peace can be made, thou muſt mourn and weep, and Repent in duſt and aſhes, and be humbled to the very mouth of Hell, before thou and thy Father be Friends again.</p>
               <p>And will not that diſcourage thee?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>No, ſayes the Returning Backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I will vet go to <hi>My Father;</hi> I will own, that I deſerve to be rejected for ever; but I'le plead the Mercifulneſs of his Nature, and the freeneſs of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Love, and Promiſe; you ſhall never beat me out of it, <hi>I will return to my Father.</hi> I know he will meet me half way; yea, he hath met me, and prevented me by his Grace; He put it into my heart to return, therefore he will accept me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I eaſily foreſee what will be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt all this. That no Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlider is able <hi>thus</hi> to argue; He is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44317:72"/> holden in the Chain of his own Sins; He durſt not uſe ſuch Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>I grant, that while he is under the full power of Backſliding, he cannot thus ſpeak, and act.</p>
               <p>But, to a <hi>Returning, Penitent Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlider,</hi> that begins to be Awakened, who feels the burden of his ſin, and ſeeks after God, the Relation of a <hi>Father,</hi> is an unſpeakable Support. And notwithſtanding his late Backſlidings, he may make out his Relation to God as <hi>his Father,</hi> when once he is awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to Repentance; Partly by his Mourning, and Godly Sorrow for Sin; Partly by the remembrance of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Covenant, and Communion with God, which, when he returns by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, may yield him comfort, though before it could not; Partly by the Inward Motions of the Spirit, which he finds luſting againſt the Fleſh; Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his vigorous importunate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to turn to God, and be at Peace with him.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:44317:72"/>
               <p>When it comes to this, he may take Heart, and ought to receive En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement by the Promiſe and Call of God, <hi>Turn you Backſliding children, and I will heal your backſlidings.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In the Words of the <hi>Text,</hi> he leaves it to them to judge, Whether it be not a moſt horrid Impiety, to pretend to joyn theſe Two together, the <hi>Divine Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> with the <hi>Impious Sacrifices of theſe Idolaters.</hi> For he makes the partaking of the <hi>Lord's Table,</hi> not only a <hi>Teſtimony of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion unto Christ, and our Communion one with another,</hi> as his Members, but alſo a <hi>Testimony of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union and Separation from all Idolatrous Worſhip.</hi>

               <hi>The Cup of Bleſſing that we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt? And the Bread that we break, &amp;c.</hi> Where we are to conſider: 1. The two Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Signs, <hi>the Cup,</hi> and <hi>the Bread.</hi> 2. What is to be underſtood by <hi>the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</hi> 3.

How <hi>the Cup</hi> and <hi>Bread</hi> in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supper, are the <hi>Communion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt:</hi> And then I ſhall help you to Apply it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the Sacramental Signs, <hi>the Cup,</hi> and <hi>the Bread.</hi> The <hi>Cup</hi> for the <hi>Wine</hi> in it, by an ordinary Figure: and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44317:75"/> the <hi>Bread which we break.</hi> Theſe are the two outward Elements in this Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and neither of them muſt be omitted. Whereas in <hi>Baptiſm</hi> there is but one outward Element, here are two. And there is good Reaſon for it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe this Repreſents the <hi>Violent Death of Chriſt,</hi> wherein his Blood was ſhed and ſeparated from his Body. It is therefore neceſſary there ſhould be one Sign to Repreſent his <hi>Body,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Sign to Repreſent his <hi>Blood,</hi> there having been a Separation by Death, which is here to be Repreſented.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> being the <hi>Myſtery of our ſpiritual Nouriſhment by Christ,</hi> it was proper to employ both <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which are the two parts of our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Nouriſhment, and that could not have been entirely Repreſented by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them alone.</p>

And in the <hi>Evangelical Hiſtory, Matth.</hi> 26. and <hi>Mark</hi> 16, What one <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt</hi> calls <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> another calls <hi>Thankſgiving.</hi> By vertue of which <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> or <hi>Prayer</hi> by a Miniſter of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Now our Lord Inſtituting his <hi>Supper,</hi> the ſame E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening after the Celebration of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> we may ſuppoſe made uſe of the ſame ſort of Bread: That is, As he changed the Signification of this Bread, from that of their unleavened Bread, to be a <hi>ſign of his Body;</hi> ſo he imployed <hi>the breaking of this Bread,</hi> to ſignifie his <hi>cruel Sufferings in that body upon the Croſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Cup,</hi> and <hi>this Bread,</hi> even <hi>after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration,</hi> (For the Bread is not broken till after that) is ſaid to be <hi>the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Body</hi> and <hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> not his real Fleſh and Blood. For, beſides the Vanity of ſuch a Senſe, and the Indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Uncomelineſs of it; yea, the Contradiction, and Impoſſibility of it; It is againſt the expreſs Teſtimony of the Apoſtle here, and in other Places. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the new Doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> Inſtead of ſaying here, <hi>The Cup that we bleſs;</hi> He would have ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>The Cup that we Tranſubſtantiate, and change into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subſtance of the Body and Blood of Chriſt:</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:44317:76"/> The Cup, in which we leave not one drop of Wine; But, by pronouncing four or five little words, fill it with the Body of Chriſt. And is not this a ſtrange way of <hi>bleſſing</hi> a Perſon or Thing? to deſtroy the very <hi>Nature of the Thing;</hi> that it ſhall be no longer what it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? The Bread was not bleſſed, that it might be deſtroyed; nor given to be eat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> that it might ceaſe to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was eaten. 'Tis to ſuppoſe God to put forth Miraculous Power, to make his own Command (of eating the Bread) impoſſible. <hi>The Bread that we break;</hi> it is therefore <hi>Bread</hi> after it is <hi>broken,</hi> after the Conſecration and breaking, <hi>it is Bread ſtill:</hi> For the <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> if there be any, is upon the Conſecration, <hi>before it be broken.</hi> But I hope moſt <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Proteſtants</hi> are pretty well Inſtructed in this <hi>Truth,</hi> and therefore I need not inſiſt longer upon it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What are we to underſtand by <hi>the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> of which this is ſaid to be the <hi>Communion?</hi> How is Chriſt's Body and Blood preſent in this <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance?</hi> Our Lord is Aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with his Human Body, and the Heavens are to contain him, till the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of all things. And therefore
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44317:77"/> as the Bread and Wine are not annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, or not deſtroyed, nor changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> So, nor preſent with, in, and under the Bread, and Wine according to the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> So that we need not ſay, that the Body and Blood of Chriſt are at all <hi>preſent</hi> there, for they are in Heaven: But the Bread and Wine are <hi>the Signs</hi> and <hi>Memorials</hi> of the Sacrifice and Sufferings of Chriſt. The <hi>Death</hi> of Chriſt, and his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> with the <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> thereof unto us are eſpecially to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by <hi>his Body</hi> and <hi>Blood:</hi> And it is in theſe that we have <hi>Communion</hi> in the Ordinance of the Supper.</p>
            <p>The Expreſſions therefore which ſome Proteſtant Writers have uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>the Real Preſence of Chriſt's Body and Blood in this Sacrament,</hi> are very<note n="*" place="bottom">See a <hi>Tract</hi> on the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, by Mr. <hi>John Hales</hi> of <hi>Eaton</hi> Colledge, in <hi>Oct.</hi>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:44317:78"/> are all one Body, and one Bread, for we are all Partakers of that one Bread.</hi> That is, We are all one Church, and one Body of Chriſt, by Covenant Union unto him; And of him we do all Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and Spiritually partake in this Ordinance: As many Grains of Corn make one Loaf, and many Members one Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We being many, are one Bread and one Body.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from that Expreſſion, might have as well argue, That all Chriſtians are ſubſtantially changed firſt into the <hi>Bread,</hi> and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>the natural Body of Chriſt,</hi> by partaking of this Sacrament; As well as that the Bread is changed into the Body of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> for all Chriſtians are ſaid to be but <hi>one Bread,</hi> and <hi>one Body,</hi> by vertue of their Communion in this Ordinance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hereby alſo we underſtand, how we have <hi>Communion</hi> in the Body and Blood of Chriſt, by the Lord's Supper: How we and others partake in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of his Death and Paſſion. And that <hi>two ways:</hi> As this Sacrament is a <hi>Sign</hi> and a <hi>Symbol</hi> of it; and as it is a <hi>Means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:44317:78"/>1. It is a <hi>Sign</hi> of it. All that eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup, do thereby Commemorate the Death and Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, and profeſs to own, that the Body and Blood of Chriſt, offered upon the Croſs, is the Food and Nouriſhment of their Souls to Eternal Life: That Chriſt is their Saviour and Redeemer; That they hope for all their Acceptance with God in both Worlds, only upon the account of the Sacrifice of Chriſt. They profeſſedly declare, that living and dying, they are, and will be <hi>his:</hi> They hope for Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over Death and the Devil, by the Croſs of Chriſt, and for a Glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from Death, as the Fruit of his Death and Reſurrection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe Words do import further, That the eating of this Bread, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Cup, are the <hi>Means</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt for our Communion in his Body and Blood. We ſhare in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of his Death and Sacrifice; and by due Attendance upon this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the precious Fruits of his Death, and the Gifts and Graces of his Spirit, are augmented and encreaſed in us, in order to our full and final Bleſſednes in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44317:79"/> the other World, which this is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory to, and fits us for.</p>
            <p>As <hi>the partaking of things ſacrificed to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,</hi> was a <hi>Fellowſhip with Devilss,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.20. So the partaking of that which was ſacrific'd to God, is a <hi>Fellowſhip with him.</hi>

               <hi>Prayer</hi> is an Act of <hi>Homage,</hi> and <hi>Praiſe</hi> of <hi>Gratitude;</hi> but we have not ſo near a Communion with a Perſon, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Petitioning for ſomewhat we want, or by returning him Thanks for a Favour received; as we have by ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with him at his <hi>Table,</hi> partaking of the ſame <hi>Bread,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Cup.</hi> In all Nations the neareſt Fellowſhip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in things of this nature. <hi>Take, Eat,</hi> manifeſts a Communion.</p>
            <p>It would be an empty Myſtery, and unworthy of an Inſtitution by <hi>Divine Goodneſs,</hi> if there were not ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God and Chriſt in it.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44317:79"/> of Life, by that which we Ea and Drink.</p>
            <p>I might conſider this <hi>Ordinance</hi> as a <hi>Sign,</hi> and <hi>Means of our Communion in the Body and Blood of Chriſt;</hi> or of our ſharing in the <hi>Fruits of his Death:</hi> And amplifie it ſeveral ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By conſidering on what Accounts this is a likely Means of ſuch a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. How <hi>Faith</hi> muſt be acted, that it may be ſo, as to us. As to the former, 1. As this <hi>Ordinance</hi> is Commemorative of the Sacrifice of Chriſt, and being to be obſerved in Remembrance of him. 2. As it is an open Profeſſion of the Croſs of Chriſt: that we glory in it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhew forth the Lord's Death that way, profeſſing our ſelves not to be aſhamed of our Character, as the <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of a crucified Jeſus.</hi> 3. As it is a Renewal and Confirmation of <hi>the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> between God and Us, through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; Renewing our Engagements and Obligations to be the <hi>Lord's</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. In the Celebration of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, we have a Special Opportunity for this: it is a principal part of our Work at this <hi>Table.</hi> 4. As it is a fit Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for extraordinary Thankſgiving and Praiſe, bleſſing God for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:44317:80"/> Which Thankfulneſs for Chriſt diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and fits us for the Reception of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Grace, as the Fruit and Purchaſe of his Death; and ſo is the Means of our Communion in his Body and Blood. Thus it is the Cup of Bleſſing and of Thankſgiving that we there Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: <hi>which Cup of Bleſſing,</hi> upon ſuch Accounts as theſe, <hi>is our Communion in the Blood of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. You will hereby the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, what is to be done on our part in order to this Communion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our <hi>Faith</hi> muſt Eye the <hi>Authority of Christ</hi> enacting it. We muſt act in Obedience to an Inſtitution and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Chriſt. It was a Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Inſtance and Act of his Kingly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to enjoyn this Memorial of his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love. And the Seaſon of its Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is the more obſervable, <hi>viz.</hi> In the cloſe of his Publick Miniſtery, of his <hi>Prophetical Office</hi> upon Earth, and in his Entrance upon the Execution of the Principal part of his <hi>Prieſtly Office,</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a Sacrifice: <hi>between both of theſe;</hi> And to render <hi>both</hi> Effectual, our Lord interpoſed an Act of his <hi>Kingly Office</hi> in the <hi>Inſtitution of this Ordinance.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it ſhould be eyed, and owned by us,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44317:80"/> in order to our Communion with him therein.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Love of Chriſt</hi> muſt eſpecially be Eyed and Attended to, in this Supper, as Expreſt by his <hi>Death and Sufferings.</hi> Of this we have here the moſt lively Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, with the Glorious Effects of that Love, which are not Repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a Beauty and Luſtre by any other Ordinance, as by this. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining <hi>Love of Christ</hi> in his <hi>whole under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,</hi> is better diſcerned and taſted in this Ordinance, than as it is propoſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Soveraignty,</hi> and the <hi>Wiſdom of God,</hi> in Inſtituting theſe <hi>External Signs and Elements,</hi> of <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> muſt alſo be Eyed, and Attended to.

            <p>How ſuitable is the <hi>plain matter</hi> of this <hi>Sacrament</hi> unto the <hi>holy Author of it.</hi> We remember in this <hi>Supper</hi> his <hi>Body hanging on the Croſs,</hi> and therefore it was not fit the <hi>Sacrament of his Body ſhould be ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

            </p>
            <p>In order to this Communion of the <hi>Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> we muſt take heed to our ſelves, not to reſt in the <hi>External Signs;</hi> but to <hi>diſcern the Lord's Body,</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the <hi>Spiritual Import and End of this Divine Inſtitution;</hi> That <hi>by Faith we may Receive Christ, and feed upon him,</hi> ſo as to Experience <hi>the Communications of his Grace,</hi> and <hi>Receive freſh Influences of his Spirit:</hi> That we may <hi>Accept all the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the New Covenant,</hi> which are here <hi>Offered and Sealed to us;</hi> and that we may <hi>Devote, Reſign, and Dedicate our ſelves afreſh to be the Lord's; to Obey him, and ſerve the Purpoſes of his Glory, while we live, in hope of the bleſſed Recompence which he has Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed and promiſed, and is gone to prepare, and which he will not fail to come again and beſtow.</hi> Until which time this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is to continue in the Church, <hi>To ſhew forth the Lord's Death till he come.</hi>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. The firſt Reflection I would make on this, is upon the Sacrilegious Confidence of thoſe Men, who deny <hi>Chriſtians the Means of their Communion in the Blood of Chriſt; who rob them of one half of this Sacrament, by denying the Cup of Bleſſing to the</hi> Laity. <hi>The Cup is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the blood of Chriſt,</hi> ſays the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> ſays our Lord. And yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not ſuffer the People to taſte it. But as <hi>one Errour makes way for another,</hi> they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that by the <hi>New Doctrine of</hi> Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitancy, <hi>the</hi> Bread, <hi>or the</hi> little Wafer, <hi>which is not</hi> broken <hi>neither, according to the order of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>but put</hi> whole <hi>into the Peoples Mouths, by the hands of the</hi> Prieſt; <hi>This</hi> Wafer <hi>ſhall be enough for the</hi> People, <hi>and by the help of a ſtrong Imagination of the Authority of their</hi> Church, <hi>the very</hi> Body, Blood, <hi>and</hi> Bones <hi>of</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under the Form and Appearance of Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One would wonder how any Thing can be plainer, both in <hi>this</hi> and the <hi>next Chapter,</hi> and in the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> it ſelf, as Recorded by the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> than the Univerſal Obligation upon Chriſtians to partake of the <hi>Cup,</hi> as well as the <hi>Bread.</hi> And what Authority can any Man, or Number of Men, have to alter
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44317:82"/> ſuch a Conſtitution? May they not as well take away <hi>the Bread</hi> from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as <hi>the Cup?</hi> They will grant that for a <hi>Thouſand Years after Chriſt, it was the Senſe and Practice of the Christian Church, that the People ſhould partake of the</hi> Cup <hi>too;</hi> And for <hi>Fourteen hundred Years, it can be proved that they did, even from the Apoſtle's Time, down to that of</hi> Thomas Aquinas <hi>in the latter end of the Thirteenth</hi> Century. Juſtin Martyr, Cyprian, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen, Chryſoſtom, <hi>and all the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Writers of the Ancient Church, are expreſs in their Teſtimony for it.</hi> But what need we concern our ſelves about the Judgment of Antiquity? When there is a Poſitive Inſtitution of Chriſt, and in a large Account thereof by <hi>the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Paul</hi> in the <hi>Eleventh</hi> Chapter, he ſpeaks but one word of the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>the Bread,</hi> but uſes divers Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, to ſignifie the Excellency of <hi>the Cup.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> ſays Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt, <hi>The Blood of the New Teſtament, ſhed for the Remiſſion of Sins of many.</hi> His ſufferings and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of his Death are in a moſt lively manner ſet forth by the ſhedding of his Blood. Not to inſiſt upon his <hi>bloody ſweat</hi> in the Garden, You know when he
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44317:82"/> was whipt, and ſcourged, and crowned with Thornes, he then ſhed <hi>Blood! Blood</hi> iſſued from his hands and Feet when he was nailed to the Croſs; and from his ſide, when he was pierced by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Soldiers. By the ſhedding of his <hi>Blood</hi> he loſt his Life and <hi>without ſhedd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Blood there could be no Remiſſion.</hi> So that to deprive the People of the <hi>Cup,</hi> is to take away the moſt lively, and the moſt eſſential Repreſentation of the Sufferings, and Death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of <hi>Concomitancy</hi> will not availe in this Caſe, The partaking of the Bread only is not ſufficient whereby to remember his Death: For the <hi>Separation</hi> of his Blood from his Body was the means of his Dying. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Diſtinction between the two Symbols, which yet are very different in their <hi>Names,</hi> in their <hi>Properties,</hi> in their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> and in the <hi>Time</hi> of receiving them. Beſides, it is contrary to all the Rules of Language, to ſay, <hi>I drink,</hi> when <hi>I only eat.</hi> But there is worſe in it ſtill; For they ſeal up the Fountain of Chriſt's Blood from the People, They pour it back again, as it were, into his Body, and ſhut up his wounds; as if his Blood were not ſhed for any but <hi>the Priests.</hi> God has appointed the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44317:83"/> Elements to increaſe the Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtians. And we ſhould not marvel, ſayes one, that they who deny the Certainty of Grace, and the Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Aſſurance, ſhould deny the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the double Elements: By their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they Preach but a <hi>half Comfort</hi> to Souls, and by their Practice they admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter but <hi>a half Sacrament</hi> to the Laity.</p>
            <p>It is true, They tell us, that we read of this Ordinance under the Name of <hi>Breaking of bread.</hi> We grant it, But they may as well conclude, That when <hi>Joſeph</hi> Feaſted and entertained his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that he gave them nothing to Drink, becauſe it is only ſaid, That <hi>they did eat with him.</hi> Can any one doubt, but when we pray for our <hi>daily bread</hi> in the Lord's Prayer, that we ask what is neceſſary for the Relief and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of our <hi>Thirſt,</hi> as well as <hi>Hunger,</hi> in that Petition?</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all that may be ſaid, againſt their Practice of denying the Cup to the People, we read in the Hiſtory of <hi>the Council of Trent,</hi> when <hi>Communion in both kinds</hi> was propoſed by thoſe who were ſent from <hi>France;</hi> In the Reply made to that Motion, They called the Cup for the Laity, <hi>a Cup of Poyſon:</hi> And among other <hi>Anathema</hi>'s
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:44317:83"/> in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> there is one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all thoſe that ſhall ſay. <hi>That the Church had not good reaſon to take away the Cup from the People;</hi> And yet they aſſign no Reaſon at all, when there is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly as much Reaſon for drinking of the Cup, as for eating of the Bread; the ſame Authority requiring both, <hi>The Cup of Bleſſing which we bleſs is the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Blood of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. With what humble Thankfulneſs ſhould we uſe this Priviledge, and obey this Order of our Lord, Remembring him in this manner, ſince thereby we have <hi>Communion in his Body and Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Night before he was betrayed, he took Bread, and took the Cup; He Inſtituted the Feaſt, and bid us Celebrate it <hi>in Remembrance of him.</hi> 
               <q>You, my Friends and Followers, as if our Lord had ſaid, I am now about to leave you, for the hour is at hand, when I ſhall be Apprehended, Bound, and Judged, Condemned, and Crucified; and then I ſhall Riſe again, and go to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God; E're long I ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived out of your ſight, you ſhall ſee me no more on Earth; you ſhall not eat and drink with me any more as you have
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44317:84"/> done; But let me not be out of your mind, when I am gone. I have loved you, and I will love you to the Death; And to morrow you ſhall ſee the proof of my Love to you, and to the loſt World, when I ſhall offer my ſelf a Sacrifice for ſin, and lay down my Life for you; And will you forget me? That you may not, I do inſtitute and appoint this Solemn Memorial of my Death, and leave it in Charge upon you, and my whole Church to the end of the World, upon all my Followers in all Ages, to <hi>do it in Remembrance of me; As often as you eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of Bleſſing, that you ſhew forth my Death till I come.</hi>
               </q> Accordingly the firſt Diſciples of Chriſt did every Lord's Day make it a part of their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip; But as the Zeal and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Chriſtians abated, the Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of Celebrating this Feaſt did abate too.</p>
            <p>But ſome will be ready to ſay, <hi>The Priviledge is ſo great I durſt not adventure. It is the Communion of the body and blood of Chriſt, I am</hi> not fit <hi>for ſo great an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; My Conſcience tells me I am utterly</hi> unworthy <hi>of ſo high a Favour; My ſins are ſo many, and my frailties ſo many, I
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44317:84"/> durſt, by no means, as yet, adventure to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, 1. That Senſe of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs and Unfitneſs, which keeps us from the performance of a plain Duty, is not true Humility. It is not Preſumption to do what we are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and to come when we are bidden, though we are Unworthy to come. We are unworthy of Food and Cloathing, Will you therefore ſtarve your ſelves, or go naked? Remember you are Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and your Refuſal thereupon may proceed from <hi>Pride,</hi> if the Senſe of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs hinder your Obedience to the Call of Chriſt. It is a bold thing, you think, for you to come; But is there no faulty Boldneſs in your neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to come, when Chriſt has bid you remember him this way? For this is not a <hi>Priviledge</hi> only, but at the ſame time it is a <hi>Duty</hi> too; And if your ſenſe of your Unworthineſs help you to come humbly and better prepared, it is one of the beſt Characters of a worthy Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but it ought not to keep you from receiving altogether.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You ſay you are unfit. <hi>It may be you ſay true.</hi> Will you continue ſo from
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44317:85"/> year to year? Is it not a Duty to fit and prepare your ſelves, to repent of all ſin, and give up your ſelves to God in Chriſt, as your God and Saviour, and then renew your Covenant? Do not you know, that the Ignorant and the impenitent, who are unfit to come to the Lords Table, are unfit to die, unfit for Heaven? And will you continue in ſuch a ſtate wherein you are unfit to die? And yet are uncertain to live an hour. Your unfitneſs is your <hi>ſin,</hi> and will you turn it into an Apology for your other Sin? It is the Duty of <hi>all real and unfeigned Chriſtians,</hi> to come to this Ordinance; And it is the Duty of all to be <hi>ſuch,</hi> that they may come. Not to Commemorate the Death of Chriſt this way, as he hath appointed it, is <hi>one ſin;</hi> To live in the neglect of due Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for it, is <hi>Another.</hi> Will your being Unprepared excuſe your not coming, when it is your duty to be ſuch as may come? How can you think God will forgive one ſin, becauſe you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit another? How can you expect he ſhould pardon your neglect of his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when all that you can ſay, is, that you neglect to fit your ſelves for it? Men will not do their duty in other things, and ſo are unfit for this. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:44317:85"/>3. How is it that you are not as much afraid of diſobeying this Command of thus Remembring the Death of Chriſt, as you are afraid of doing it Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? You are afraid you ſhould offend God by coming; But ought you not to fear, leſt you offend him by ſtaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? Should not a total neglect be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended a Fault, as well as an undue Performance? You do well to fear Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiving; O be but as fearful to continue Unworthy, and Unfit to receive! This equal fear of Caution on both ſides, would make you dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and ſolicitous to fit and prepare your ſelves. And this concerns thoſe, who have formerly been at the Lord's Table, but very often do tarry away, though they have time and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as being afraid to come by reaſon of their own Unworthineſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider further, What are thoſe ſins that you charge your ſelves with, as the ground of your <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfitneſs.</hi> They are either of <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> or of <hi>Wilfulneſs;</hi> Either ſuch as can hardly be avoided by the Care and Watchfulneſs of Good Men, as ſins of daily infirmity. Theſe do not make you unfit for the Lord's Table: For if they did, who at all
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44317:86"/> would ever be fit? If a perfect ſinleſs Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were neceſſary, none could come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. And by ſuch a thought we make Chriſt an hard Maſter. But if they be ſins of <hi>Wilfulneſs,</hi> you are Self-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned if you do not Reform. And yet how many are there, concerning whom we may charitably judge, that they do not allow themſelves in wilful ſins, that do yet tarry away from this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let me ask you further, Have you ever tryed to fit and prepare your ſelves, as worthy Receivers of the Lord's Supper? Have you endeavoured, in the uſe of all God's appointed Means, to obtain that Knowledge, Repentance, Faith, and Love, which ſhould fit you for this Ordinance? If you have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed the Means that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; if you have never ſeriouſly and in good earneſt ſet about the Work of Preparation, How can you ſay that you never ſhall, or can be fitted for this Priviledge? What Miniſter of Chriſt have you ever conſulted about it? It may be you miſtake the very Notion of the Lord's Supper, and underſtand not the True Nature and Deſign of it.

            <p n="6">6. Therefore let me ask you again, Is not your Unfitneſs from <hi>ſloath and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleneſs,</hi> or the <hi>distracting hurry</hi> of <hi>Worldly Affairs,</hi> that you cannot be brought to <hi>ſpare ſo much time,</hi> as is neceſſary for <hi>this Work?</hi> How will you Anſwer this at the Great Day? Will you then have the Courage to tell the Lord Redeemer to his Face, what this Pretence amounts to? Will you tell him in that Awful Solemnity, <hi>Lord, I would not have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Ordinance of the Supper, but have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred Thee, and thy dying Love, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bread;</hi> But, <hi>I was</hi> unfit <hi>for it, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> unfit, <hi>becauſe my Mind was distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the cares of the World: I had ſo much of other matters all the Week, from Moneth to Moneth, to take up my Thoughts and Time, that I had no leiſure for ſerious Preparation.</hi> What ſelf-condemning Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes will theſe prove at laſt?</p>
            <p>

That you muſt be more conſtant in ſecret Prayer; That you muſt ſet up daily Family Prayer in your houſes; That you muſt ſpend more Time in Reading; be more careful of your Company, and be more faithful and exact in your Dealings, and do many things that now you neglect?</p>
            <p>How dreadful is the Import of ſuch an Excuſe for not Coming? of ſuch a Ground for ſtaying away. For it ſeems to lye in this, <hi>That Men are reſolved they will live at large, and not be bound up by the Rules of the Goſpel;</hi> That is, They never mean to take upon them the <hi>Yoke of Chriſt,</hi> or to live as his Diſciples; If they would ſpeak it out, it muſt ſignifie thus much; <hi>Thou ſhalt not be my Lord and Redeemer, I will not deny <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and Worldly Luſts, and live Soberly, and Righteouſly, and Godly, in this World; Notwithstanding my baptiſm, whereby I have ſworn Fidelity to Chriſt, he ſhall not reign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me.</hi> This is practically, and, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, their Senſe: For this Command

            <p n="1">1.

            </p>
            <p>And if we have not been <hi>melted under the ſenſe of pardoning, Mercy to our ſelves, and brought to a better Temper of Mind, as to the Forgiveneſs of Others.</hi> If we have not had <hi>Love to our Fellow-Chriſtians more excited in us, to all that are Members of the ſame Body;</hi> though they err and miſtake, though they diner from us, though they be angry with us, though they think hardly of us, and ſpeak hardly againſt us: Yet if we have not had <hi>our Spirits brought to a Temper able to forgive them, to pray for them, and be ready to do them good, &amp;c.</hi> We cannot ſay, we have had <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt in his Ordinance.</hi> For ſuch Effects as theſe wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>

            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Method</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> makes uſe of, in this and the foregoing <hi>Chapter,</hi> when he deſigned to Reform the ſcandalous Abuſe of <hi>the Lord's Supper,</hi> which theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were guilty of. After he had Explained the <hi>Nature of the Inſtitution,</hi> and opened the <hi>Deſign</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of it, he had Repreſented it, as the <hi>Communion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt:</hi> He tells them what moſt manifeſtly follows from thence, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Greatneſs of the Sin,</hi> to <hi>eat of that Bread,</hi> and <hi>drink of that Cup un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily;</hi> that if they do it without <hi>Self Examination,</hi> they <hi>are guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord;</hi> They offend againſt the <hi>Lord Redeemer,</hi> who hath appointed this <hi>Sacred Rite,</hi> and even againſt <hi>his Body and Blood,</hi> which are Signified and Repreſented by the Bread and Wine,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:44317:91"/> as the <hi>Memorial</hi> and <hi>Sign</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>This, to thoſe that have any due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the <hi>Authority and Love of a dying Saviour,</hi> one would think ſhould be Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument enough; But leaſt it ſhould not, beſides the <hi>Declaration of their Sin,</hi> he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces <hi>the Puniſhment of it</hi> in theſe Words; That ſuch <hi>do eat and drink Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein we have <hi>Firſt,</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of their <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> who do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily partake of the Lord's Supper, That <hi>they eat and drink Damnation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

            </p>
            <p>That which we Tranſlate <hi>Diſcern,</hi> it is well known, ſignifies <hi>to make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between one thing and another;</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 15.19. So, <hi>not to diſcern the Lord's body,</hi> is not to difference and diſtinguiſh concerning it, to look no further than the outward ſenſe, not to make a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between <hi>common and ſacramental bread,</hi> not to eye the <hi>body and blood of Chriſt,</hi> as ſignified by the <hi>Sacramental Elements;</hi> not to remember or conſider his <hi>cruel Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> which this ſhould put us in Mind of.

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44317:101"/> Worſhip: All theſe will aggravate your ſin; But the Poſſibility of doing other Services of Religion amiſs, is not count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſufficient Reaſon for the not doing 'em.</p>
            <p>After all ſuch pretences and excuſes, there is too much Reaſon to think, that the moſt are afraid of coming to this Ordinance, leſt the preparing for it, and the conſequent Duties which they know are required, ſhould interrupt their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Pleaſures, or their inordinate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the World, and oblige them to leave their ſins, which, as yet, they have no mind to part with. Such as theſe ought not to come indeed, they have other work <hi>firſt</hi> to do: They are <hi>firſt</hi> called to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt, and afterwards to <hi>the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Body and Blood.</hi> They are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to underſtand and own their <hi>Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Covenant</hi> by the Anſwer of a good Conſcience, and then to <hi>renew it</hi> at the Table of the Lord; This Priviledge belongs not to them, till they have tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repented, and forſaken ſin, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to be the Lord's.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Object.</hi> But others are ready to ſay, <hi>I would come, and have had many a Thought about it; But I doubt of my own Sincerity,

            </p>
            <p>Several things may be ſaid in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That many miſtake the Nature of <hi>true Faith and Sincerity,</hi> and think, if they have not <hi>Aſſurance of the Love of God,</hi> that therefore they have no true Faith. They make ſaving Juſtifying Faith to conſiſt in believing the ſpecial Love of Chriſt to their Souls, in believing that their ſins are pardoned, and that they are in Chriſt. But this is a dangerous Miſtake, which one would wonder, under ſuch clear Light as we enjoy, ſhould be ſo <hi>common.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For how unſpeakable is the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the Truth of Grace, and the Knowledge of its being true; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:44317:102"/> a hearty Conſent to the <hi>Terms of the Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Reflex Act of Faith,</hi> ſo as to be able to ſay, <hi>I know my Intereſt in the Covenant.</hi> Many a <hi>falſe Profeſſor</hi> may flatter himſelf, <hi>that his Faith is true,</hi> when it is not; and many an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright Chriſtian</hi> may doubt and queſtion, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be one or no?</hi> But the <hi>Latter</hi> ſhall one Day be aſhamed of their <hi>Fears,</hi> as the <hi>Former</hi> of their <hi>Hopes.</hi> The <hi>Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> when many that are <hi>His,</hi> do not know it <hi>themſelves.</hi> And if a Miniſter of Chriſt will ask a few <hi>home cloſe Queſtions</hi> of ſuch <hi>doubting, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Chriſtians,</hi> by which their <hi>hearty conſent to the Covenant</hi> may be judged of: Their Anſwers plainly ſhew, <hi>That they believe in Chriſt, and love him above all the World, and regard no Iniquity in their hearts;</hi> And yet will continue to doubt of their <hi>Integrity,</hi> though the Bent of their Hearts, and the Endeavours of their Lives, do abundantly prove that they are <hi>Sincere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2ly. However, it may ordinarily be known <hi>whether your Faith be of the right kind or no;</hi> and <hi>whether you are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright towards God or no.</hi> We are bid to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and Search, and try, and <hi>prove our ſelves,</hi> in order to it; that we may

            </p>
            <p>Such doubting Chriſtians would do well to Conſult ſome Faithful Miniſter of Chriſt, and Repreſent the State of their own Caſe, what they feel; that ſo they may be told what it doth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and be help'd to judge of themſelves.</p>
            <p>It is granted, that you know how it is with you, better than any Miniſter can do: For, as<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
               </note> One well expreſſes it, <hi>A Patient knows better than any Phyſician what he feels; but a Phyſician when he hears it, can tell from what Cauſe it comes, and what is the Nature of the Diſeaſe, and what is like to come of it, and what is the proper Method for a Cure.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="189" facs="tcp:44317:103"/>
            <p>There is a great deal of Reaſon, why you ſhould expect and hope for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of your Doubts in ſuch Caſes, by conſulting ſome Miniſter of Chriſt; eſpecially him, under whoſe Miniſtry you have choſen to place your ſelves, as the Helper of your Faith, and Joy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Penitent Chriſtian, <hi>though he want Aſſurance,</hi> is Accepted of God, and hath Right to this <hi>Ordinance,</hi> whether he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it or no.

For <hi>All ſuch who unfeignedly conſent to the</hi> Covenant,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44317:104"/> 
               <hi>they may, and ought to come, to ſignifie their Conſent, and to receive the Seal of the</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

            </p>
            <p>The proper Remedy, is to Reſolve Unfeignedly <hi>to pleaſe God, and obey him in this, and all other Inſtances;</hi> and then <hi>do this in Remembrance of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>as what all his Followers are obliged to do.</hi> It may be that Ignorance of thy State, from whence thy Doubts proceeds, is owing to the Neglect of <hi>Self Examination,</hi> and <hi>the uſe of proper Means to know thy Self.</hi>

            <p n="5">5.

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:44317:109"/> In all Ages of the Chriſtian Church, there have been ſome, ready to give this Proof of their Love to <hi>Him</hi> who ſpake theſe words, by not loving their Lives unto the Death, when they ſtood in Competition with their Fidelity to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And with how much the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Chearfulneſs and Alacrity, Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Deſire, they did it; by ſo much the more powerful, and conſtraining was the Principle of Love. By this we may make ſome Judgment, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Love it was, wherewith the Lord Redeemer loved us, when <hi>he gave Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us an Offering, and a Sacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling Odour unto God.</hi> The <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarineſs</hi> of his Sacrifice argued the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> of his <hi>Incomparable Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though <hi>his Death</hi> was <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> with reſpect to the Eternal Purpoſe and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Heaven, For it was by <hi>the determinate Counſel of God,</hi> that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould ſuffer Death; And though it were <hi>Violent,</hi> with reſpect to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentality of Men in his Crucifixion, <hi>they did it with violent hands:</hi> Yet with reference to himſelf, <hi>his Death was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,</hi> He made a willing Sacrifice of his own Life; <hi>He laid it down;</hi> None elſe could have taken it from him. <hi>He gave himſelf a Ranſom, He became Poor,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:44317:109"/> He made himſelf of no Reputation, He poured out his Soul unto Death,</hi> It was not rent from him. <hi>He was obedient to Death, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Death of the Croſs. This</hi> gave an extraordinary value to his Sufferings: Upon this depended the Merit of his Sacrifice, and the Efficacy of his Blood. And <hi>this</hi> is one endearing Circumſtance, which heightens his Love, and calls for our thankful Admiration.</p>
            <p>He willingly offered himſelf in the firſt Council of Peace about our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and undertook to ſuffer for us, and make ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice. And after his Incarnation, he always knew, and frequently foretold his own Sufferings and Death. He reproves <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as if he acted the Devil's part, when he would have diſſwaded him from it. Yea, he moſt earneſtly deſired this moſt bloody Baptiſm, <hi>I have a Baptiſm to be Baptized with, and how am I ſtraitened till it be accompliſhed?</hi> Luke 12.50. The night before his Sufferings he makes his laſt Will and Teſtament, and leaves it with his Diſciples, Giving <hi>his blood</hi> to drink in the Sacrament, to ſhow, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>With deſire have I deſired to eat this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover with you, before I ſuffer.</hi> As if he had ſaid, The Sufferings I have ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſpoke of, are now approaching; The hour is at hand, when I ſhall be betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Crucified; This is <hi>the laſt Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover</hi> I ſhall ever keep with you, before I am lifted up from the Earth; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I moſt earneſtly deſire it, becauſe it is <hi>the laſt,</hi> that will precede my Death: Whereby I ſhall put an end to theſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Services, which have all along re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to me, and to the Sacrifice and Oblation I am to make for ſin. Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth I will eat and drink no more of the Paſſover Supper, for my own Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Death is that which they ſignified, and related to. I am the true <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> All the Rites and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances about the killing, and eating of it, were but Typical of my Paſſion, and ſhall now be fulfilled.</p>
            <pb n="203" facs="tcp:44317:110"/>
            <p>And here, 1. I ſhall conſider <hi>the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover,</hi> which our Lord deſired to eat of. 2.

               </gap> Man and Beaſt. The <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> were ordered by <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſlay a Lamb, on the Fourteenth day of the Firſt Month, which anſwers to our

               <hi>March,</hi> and to Sprinkle the Poſts of their Doors with the Blood of that Lamb, and to feed upon the Fleſh of it, in their ſeveral Families. That very Night the deſtroying Angel ſtrikes the Firſt-born of every Family, where this Command, of ſprinkling the Door-poſts with the Blood of the Lamb, was not obſerved. On this, you know, they were delivered out of <hi>Egypt</hi> the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> not only giving leave, but d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The whole Inſtitution of the Paſchal Lamb is called by the Name of <hi>the Paſſover,</hi> though it refer eſpecially to <hi>the firſt Lamb in Egypt,</hi> whoſe blood was ſprinkled on the Door-poſts of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> Houſes, when the deſtroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel paſſed them by.

               </gap>ated. And this alſo is common in Scripture, to give the Name of <hi>the thing ſignified,</hi> to the <hi>Sign</hi> which repreſents it. So the Jews are ſaid to k ll the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> that is, <hi>the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb,</hi> which was in remembrance of the Angels paſſing by their Houſes, and their conſequent Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Thus <hi>Circumciſion</hi> is called <hi>the Covenant</hi> of God, And <hi>the Rock</hi> in the Wilderneſs is called <hi>Christ,</hi> And the <hi>Seven Candlesticks</hi> in St. <hi>John's</hi> Viſion, are the <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> That is, Theſe are ſignified, and repreſented by them.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore very abſurd for the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> to inſiſt upon theſe Words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> to prove, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Chriſt's Fleſh and Blood is in the Sa rament. They may as well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, That <hi>the Paſchal Lamb</hi> that Chriſt did eat with his Diſciples, was <hi>the ſame</hi> with that which was ſlain by the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:44317:112"/> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> Or that it was not <hi>an Animal,</hi> becauſe it is called <hi>a Paſſover;</hi> Or that the Paſchal Lamb was <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated</hi> into the <hi>Fleſh</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called <hi>our Paſſover,</hi> and ſometimes called <hi>the Lamb of God,</hi> as well as <hi>the Bread</hi> in the Sacrament called <hi>his Body,</hi> and the <hi>Wine</hi> his <hi>Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I leave this Head, I might mention the <hi>Hiſtorical Evidence,</hi> that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to that of the Holy Scriptures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the Iſraelites Paſſover in Egypt</hi> and the ſprinkling of their Door-poſts with the Blood of the Lamb, in that Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Night of their Delîverance. For the better underſtanding whereof, we may conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>the Jews,</hi> after the Death of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> were ſeveral times in Subjection to the Neighbouring Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and could not have had the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to keep up ſuch a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> were ſet apart by God, and Conſecrated to him in a Solemn manner, in ſtead of the Firſt-born of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that were preſerved in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as you read, Numb. 3.12, 13. <hi>For when I ſmote all the Firſt-born in Egypt, I hallowed unto me all the Firſt-born of Iſrael.

               <hi>Epiphanius</hi> relates, <q>That at the ſame time of the Year, the Night before the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:44317:113"/> went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when the Firſt-born in <hi>Egypt</hi> were ſlain, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were wont to mark their Houſes, their Trees, their Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with <hi>red;</hi> by that, as by a kind of <hi>Taliſman,</hi> thinking to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſome ſuch Miſchief and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as their Fathers experienced at that time, and which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> eſcaped, by following the Advice of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to Sprinkle the Door-poſts of their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with <hi>Blood.</hi>
               </q> Some ſuch Cuſtom as this continued in <hi>Egypt,</hi> even after the Incarnation of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Having ſpoken thus much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the Jewiſh Paſſover,</hi> Let me now conſider <hi>our Lord's deſire to eat of it. With deſire have I deſired to eat of this Paſsover before I ſuffer. With deſire have I deſired.</hi> An uſual <hi>Hebraiſm,</hi> to ſignifie the earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and vehemency of his Deſire. The Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> hath many Inſtances of this, agreeable to other Expreſſions in other places, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.14. <hi>In bleſſing I will bleſs thee, and in multiplying I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll multiply thee.</hi> The Zeal, and Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Ardency of his Deſire is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by it: Agreeable to that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned place, which referr'd to his Death and Sacrifice, Luk. 12.50. <hi>I have a Baptiſm to be baptized with, and how am I
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:44317:113"/> ſtraitened till it be accompliſhed.</hi> As if he could not live in Eaſe, have no Reſt or Quiet, till he was made a Sacrifice. And that is the <hi>firſt</hi> and great Reaſon of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring this Paſſover,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe this was to be <hi>the Laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he Suffered.</hi> Therefore he ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires it. The near approach of his Sufferings did not at all abate his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and Deſire of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffering, but rather gave an Edge to his Affection. He was ſo far from being diſheartened by the near Proſpect of his <hi>Crucifixion,</hi> that the nearer he comes to it, the more he deſires it; And therefore deſires to eat of <hi>this Paſsover,</hi> which was to be his <hi>laſt:</hi> And then makes his Laſt Will, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes <hi>this Supper</hi> the ſame Evening, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous every thing ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, that was neceſſary or fit to be done before he Suffered.</p>
            <p>It was the Laſt Night of his Life, and the Night wherein he was to be Betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and foreknew he ſhould be ſo. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſſovers Prefigured his Death, this did both Prefigure and Accompany it: for his Death was now in a manner preſent. 'Twas this that made him long, and deſire to eat this Paſſover, Though
<pb facs="tcp:44317:114"/> at the ſame time he had ſo near a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Amazing Sufferings in the Garden that Night, and on the Croſs the next day. Could we underſtand the Agonies of his tormented mind, that made him complain, <hi>That his Soul was ſorrowful even unto death,</hi> and Pray with doubled and trebled Importunity, <hi>that the Cup might paſs from him;</hi> we may then judge of his Love in deſiring to eat of <hi>this Paſſover,</hi> for this reaſon, becauſe <hi>his Laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Reaſon may be, <hi>To give us an Example of Obedience:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being <hi>made under the Law,</hi> he would exactly obſerve it; And ſo for our ſakes fulfil all Righteouſneſs, as in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtances, of Subjection to his own Creatures, of paying Tribute to his own Subjects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, to teach us Humility, a little before this, he would waſh the Feet of his own <hi>Diſciples,</hi> with thoſe hands, which, juſt after this Paſſover, had all Power in Heaven and Earth Solemnly given into them.</p>
            <p>And not only as to the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> But he ſtooped down to the very Frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <hi>the Ceremonial Law,</hi> as an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Obedience. And therefore the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:44317:114"/> Skin of his Fleſh was Circumciſed, and his Holy Mother Purified; And he that was <hi>the true Paſſover,</hi> would keep <hi>the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical one;</hi> And ſo, as one well expreſſes it, did obediently ſtand under his own Shadow.</p>
            <p n="3">3. One Reaſon of his Deſire to eat of this Paſſover, might be, <hi>to put an end to the Sacraments of the Legal Inſtitution.</hi> And therefore after the eating of <hi>the Paſſover,</hi> he inſtituted <hi>the Lords Supper,</hi> which ſucceeds in its room; Which is a Feaſt upon the Sacrifice of Chriſt, the <hi>True Lamb of God, the true Chriſtian Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> in <hi>Remembrance</hi> of our <hi>Deliverance</hi> by Him from <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> from <hi>Death</hi> and the <hi>Devil.</hi> Thoſe things therefore that were but <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of Him, muſt ceaſe after his Death, the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> of them being now Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, as I ſhall ſhew preſently.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another Reaſon might be, <hi>That he might have Fellowſhip and Communion with his Diſciples.</hi> And that leads to the conſideration of the Third thing.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Company</hi> with whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to eat this his laſt Paſſover, <hi>With You.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> tell us concerning the Number of thoſe that were to eat the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:44317:115"/> Paſſover, That it was not to be under <hi>Ten,</hi> for the whole Lamb was to be eaten: Nor above <hi>Twenty,</hi> leſt they ſhould need two Lambs. Therefore our Lord ſent word to one of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to prepare every thing for that Solemnity; that the Houſe might be ſearched if there were any <hi>Leavened Bread</hi> left in it; Which they were wont to do very carefully in every corner, ſaying, <hi>Bleſsed art thou, O Lord, who haſt Sanctified us by thy Precepts:</hi> And then throwing a little Duſt into the Air, they uſed theſe words, or the like, <hi>If there be any leavened Bread in this Houſe, let it be as this duſt, cast into the Air.</hi> But the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Reaſon of ſending word before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, might be, becauſe the Perſons in the Family were to be numbred. And it is not improbable, but there were more Men than the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and our <hi>Lord,</hi> who were preſent at the eating of this Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and it may be ſome Women too. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is probable, That the <hi>Man and his Family,</hi> in whoſe Houſe it was, did eat of the Paſſover with <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles. Secondly,</hi> The Expreſſions of the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> are very conſiderable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him that ſhould betray him.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:44317:115"/> There is a <hi>Threefold Gradation;</hi> He ſays, firſt, in the General, <hi>One of you ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray me:</hi> And afterwards he comes near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſays, <hi>One of the Twelve;</hi> Or, of my <hi>Apostles,</hi> often ſo called: So that at the eating of this Paſſover, there ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been more preſent than the <hi>Twelve Apostles.</hi> And afterwards he particularizeth the Perſon, <hi>He that dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his hand with me in the diſh. Thirdly,</hi> We read that <hi>the Virgin Mary,</hi> and two or three other Women, did uſually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him, and were then at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> to eat the Paſſover: For the next day <hi>the Virgin Mary</hi> was ſtanding by the Croſs, when our Lord was Crucified: And it being the Jewiſh Cuſtom for the Relations to join together at the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Supper, it is not unlikely that ſhe did eat the Paſſover with Chriſt; And it being in the Houſe of one of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſhe might tarry there that night, while he went out from thence about <hi>Eleven</hi> or <hi>Twelve a Clock</hi> at Night into the Garden, where he was betrayed and taken; And ſhe hearing of his being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, might go to the High Prieſts Hall, and be at the Croſs the next Morning, at <hi>Nine a Clock.</hi>

            <p n="4">IV. Let us conſider <hi>the Time</hi> when, <hi>Before I Suffer.</hi> There is a great Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie about <hi>the Time of this Paſsover.</hi> It was certainly upon <hi>Thurſday-night,</hi> He being Crucified on the <hi>Fryday</hi> in the <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,</hi> though he did not give up the Ghoſt till <hi>Three</hi> in the <hi>Afternoon.</hi> But the Queſtion will be, whether it was at <hi>the ſame Time,</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> kept their <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover,</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:44317:116"/> or <hi>a Day ſooner;</hi> And if it was a Day ſooner, How could the <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> be killed, which was to be brought to the Temple, and be killed by the Prieſts, <hi>between the two Evenings</hi> of the <hi>Fourteenth</hi> day, the firſt whereof began when the Sun began to decline, or as ſoon as Mid-day was paſt; The other Evening was after Sun-ſet. Some Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men think it is plain, That the Time when our Lord did eat this <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover</hi> with his Diſciples, was the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Generality of the <hi>Jews</hi> kept theirs, from <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.28. <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.14.</p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding of this, you muſt know that the Time for the Obſervation of the <hi>Jewiſh Feſtivals,</hi> was Regulated by the Appearance of <hi>the New Moon. They had not</hi> Almanacks<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <hi>in thoſe days, as we have now, to tell us before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand when</hi> will be a New-Moon. <hi>But (if we may believe the Jewiſh Writers) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time when they expected a New Moon, they ſent Men to watch for it on the Top of ſome Hill, or High place; and he who could firſt diſcover</hi> a New-Moon, <hi>was to tell the Prieſt, and he to Blow the Trumpet, to give
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:44317:117"/> the people notice, that there was</hi> a New-Moon. <hi>But, in caſe of Cloudy weather, if in Three days time, from their firſt expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, no Man could ſee</hi> a New-Moon, <hi>they did then venture (but not before) to blow the Trumpet without ſeeing it, which muſt needs cauſe a very great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty, and the ſame Moon be ſooner ſeen at one place then at another, and the Paſsover kept accordingly.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is certain, that ſomewhat more than <hi>the Hiſtory</hi> was deſigned. All the Sacrifices and Ceremonies of the <hi>Moſaick Inſtitution,</hi> were but <hi>Shadows of good things to come, But the Subſtance is Chriſt,</hi> Coloſ. 2.17. <hi>He</hi> is ſo even of <hi>the Jewiſh Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> For the <hi>Jews</hi> can never aſſign any pertinent and ſolid Reaſon of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover-Rites, if there were no Reference to the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> What need of the Choice and Separation of <hi>a Lamb</hi> in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?

No Reaſon can well be aſſign'd of ſuch Rites and Orders, but by the Doctrine of the <hi>New Teſtament:</hi> Theſe things are thereby diſcover'd to be Excellent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems of the great Myſtery of our Lord's Death.</p>

The whole Deſign therefore of <hi>this Paſlover-Feast,</hi> had an <hi>Aspect</hi> upon the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and does Admirably Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt, <hi>the Lamb of God,</hi> Sacrificed for us; By whoſe <hi>Blood</hi> we have a Spiritual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan;</hi> as by the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> they had a Deliverance from the <hi>deſtroying Angel;</hi> and afterwards a Deliverance from the <hi>Egyptian Bondage.</hi> Even the <hi>Hiſtory of the Inſtitution of this Paſſover,</hi> ſhows a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Reference to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> For we read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.46. concerning the <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb; Neither ſhall ye break a Bone thereof.</hi> And this is ſaid to be fulfilled in <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Antitype,</hi> as if pronounced immediately of him, <hi>John</hi> 19. <hi>When the Souldiers found him dead, they brake not his Bones, as of the other two.</hi> And it follows <hi>Theſe things were done, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which ſays, A Bone of him ſhall not be broken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Faithful</hi> under the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> did ſo regard theſe Things: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Moſes,</hi> who eſteemed <hi>the Reproach of</hi> Chriſt <hi>as greater Riches than the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of</hi> Egypt, and therefore did know <hi>him, is ſaid to have kept the Paſſover in Faith,</hi> Heb. 11.28.

               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:44317:120"/> ſpeaks all along of <hi>Faith in the Mediator,</hi> and not of <hi>Faith</hi> in God <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</hi> But,</p>

            <p>Some <hi>Inferences</hi> of Truth and Duty, may be collected, as the <hi>Application</hi> of what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Believers,</hi> under the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament</hi> and under <hi>the New,</hi> have <hi>the ſame Object of Faith. They did eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat, and drink the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Drink</hi> Their Sacraments and ours
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:44317:126"/> have different Signs, but in <hi>Substance</hi> were the ſame: Theirs having Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as well as ours. Accordingly we read of <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> and the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> in a ſpiritual ſenſe under the <hi>Gospel;</hi> And that which anſwers to <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> with us: Even they, under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> had. 1 Cor. 10.2, 3. They were under <hi>the Covenant of Grace,</hi> though not ſo clear a <hi>Dispenſation</hi> of it as we; They were to be Saved by <hi>Faith</hi> in a <hi>Mediator,</hi> as well as we: <hi>The Gospel was preached unto them, as well as unto us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Did Chriſt deſire <hi>Fellowſhip with his Diſciples, Friends, and Followers in the Paſſover;</hi> What ſhall we think of thoſe that deſpiſe ſuch <hi>Institutions,</hi> and look upon themſelves as <hi>above ſuch Ordinances,</hi> as if they had a nearer, and better way of Communion with God and Chriſt; then this Remiſsneſs and Indifference, as to theſe things, Neglect and Careleſneſs in Preparation for them, is likewiſe a degree of Contempt, that deſerves to be Reproved.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Was Chriſt ſo deſirous to eat his laſt Paſſover before he ſuffered for us, becauſe of his <hi>Willingneſs</hi> to Suffer?
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:44317:127"/> What Ingratitude does this imply in our Backwardneſs, and Cowardize, when we are called to ſuffer for him?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Did our Lord deſire to eat <hi>this Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi> becauſe it was <hi>the laſt,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently was <hi>Willing to be a Sacrifice for us?</hi> What an Argument of <hi>his endearing Love</hi> does this afford us? And how ſhould it Enflame ours to him? It was not from <hi>Ignorance</hi> of what he was to Suffer; he fully knew what he had undertaken, he perfectly underſtood what his <hi>Baptiſm of Blood</hi> did ſignifie; and yet he <hi>earneſtly deſired</hi> it, and was ſtraitned, till it was Accompliſhed. He knew the Burden <hi>of Sin</hi> that he was to Expiate, as a <hi>Sin-Offering,</hi> when he <hi>bore our Sins in his own Body on the Tree,</hi> as a Sacrifice to <hi>Divine Justice</hi> for us: He knew the <hi>bitterneſs of that Cup,</hi> which he was to drink of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand; and yet for our ſakes he deſires it: What Thankfulneſs do we owe for ſuch ineſtimable Love!</p>
            <p>He was willing to ſubmit to ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Terms to bring about our <hi>Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation</hi> to God: He was willing <hi>to be obedient to Death, even the Death of the Croſs,</hi> to turn away <hi>the Divine Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> from us, and to reſtore us to the <hi>Divine Favour, and Image</hi> again. He
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:44317:127"/> was willing to be a <hi>Sacrifice for ſin,</hi> that we might be made <hi>the Righteouſneſs of God, through Faith in him.</hi> He was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>to bear the Curſe,</hi> that the <hi>Bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come upon us.</hi> He was willing to be <hi>our Paſchal Lamb,</hi> to be <hi>ſlain and ſacrificed</hi> for us, that by the <hi>ſprinkling of his Blood</hi> we might be delivered from <hi>Sin and Hell,</hi> that by feeding on him as <hi>our Paſsover,</hi> we might be Partakers of <hi>Spiritual and Eternal Life.</hi> And even in the midſt of his <hi>Agony</hi> in the <hi>Garden,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſtrugling of his <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature</hi> againſt the bitterneſs of the Cup, which made him pray for the paſſing of it away; yet as <hi>Mediator he was willing,</hi> and therefore adds. <hi>Not my Will, but thine be done; Father glorifie thy ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O matchleſs and incomprehenſible Love! How ſhould our Souls be Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed with the Contemplation of it! How hard and inſenſible are our Hearts, if they <hi>feel no conſtraining Vertue</hi> in the Conſideration of ſuch <hi>Love!</hi> If we do not Sacrifice our Luſts in Requital of his being a willing Sacrifice for us. Shall not <hi>the Love of Chriſt,</hi> which bubbles up in every <hi>Drop of his Blood,</hi> and made him willing, and reſolved to <hi>ſhed</hi> it on our Account, make us hate that Sin, which he died to Atone for, and to deſtroy. Can
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:44317:128"/> we conſider him, <hi>Groaning, Sweating, Bleeding, Dying for Sin,</hi> and yet Retain an Affection to it? And ruſh into it through the Wounds, and Blood, and Agony, and Death of <hi>our Redeemer?</hi> Shall that ever be ſweet to us, which put ſo much Vinegar and Gall into his Cup?</p>
            <p>Let me add a few Words for <hi>Counſel</hi> and <hi>Direction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Did Chriſt earneſtly deſire <hi>to eat this Paſsover,</hi> and have Communion with his Diſciples therein?

How did <hi>David</hi>'s Heart pant, and faint, and long for Communion with God in the Services of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to eat the <hi>Paſso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> in haſte, <hi>with greedineſs of deſire; Non lento Corde, non languido Ore:</hi> And is it not a Shame to us to have no Appetite for ſuch a <hi>Feaſt?</hi> Is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t not for want of ſuch Deſires of Communion with Chriſt, that we meet with ſo little Satisfaction when we come? <hi>Let him that is a thirſt, come,</hi> and <hi>ſuch ſhall be filled,</hi> when others ſhall be <hi>ſent empty away: but the hungry Souls ſhall not be ſent empty away, from the Lord's Table.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>In this <hi>Chapter,</hi> Chriſt and the Church ſeem to ſtrive, who ſhall outvie each other in their <hi>Encomiums,</hi> and <hi>Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> In the Two firſt Verſes <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaks: In the following you have the <hi>Voice of the Church,</hi> or the <hi>Language of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtians;</hi> They Praiſe, and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, and Extol <hi>the Lord Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Fourth Verſe,</hi> for his Bounty and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, in making ſuch Rich Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to Feaſt and Entertain them. She had ſaid before in the <hi>Third Verſe,</hi> That <hi>She ſate under his Shadow with great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and his Fruit was ſweet unto her Taſte:</hi> And thereupon adds this Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Rich Proviſions, <hi>He brought me into the Banquetting-houſe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where, 1. She deſcribes the Place, or the Means of ſuch a Spiritual Feaſt, <hi>The Banquetting-houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Welcom</hi> ſhe met with there, <hi>His Banner over me was Love.</hi> Under <hi>the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:44317:131"/> firſt Expreſſion,</hi> is Repreſented the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Proviſion, which our Lord makes, to Entertain the Souls of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: He led me to the <hi>Houſe of Wine,</hi> the Place where the Maſter of the Houſe was wont to entertain his Friends; <hi>Where the Wine is drank,</hi> or the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment made; for ſo the Word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies. Some underſtand it of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where Chriſtians Aſſemble and meet together, to Worſhip Chriſt, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Communication of his Grace; the Places where the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> are Diſpenſed. But there is more than the Places of ſuch Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, here meant, <hi>viz.</hi> All the ſpecial Means, and Inſtruments of Bleſſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Souls of Believers. It may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Word, the Sacraments,</hi> the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies for Worſhip,</hi> and all the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Chriſt.</hi> But amongſt them all, none more fitly, or exactly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Allegory, than <hi>the holy Supper of the World,</hi> the great <hi>Feaſt on the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt,</hi> where we hope to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained to Morrow.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Welcom</hi> ſhe met with, <hi>His Banner over me was Love.</hi> His <hi>Standard</hi> towards me, by the lifting up whereof
<pb facs="tcp:44317:132"/> I was invited, and drawn to come over to his ſide, to yield to him, to give up my ſelf to him. The Love of a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Saviour is diſplayed like a Banner, to invite and draw Souls to Chriſt. Therefore it is promiſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.22. <hi>I will lift up my Hand to the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and ſet up my Standard to the people.</hi> Chriſt the Captain of our Salvation, lifted up upon a Croſs, Diſplays a <hi>Banner of Love</hi> to all the World, to invite them to come to him. And the <hi>Motto</hi> of his <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> is nothing but this, <hi>Dying Love Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious;</hi> Or, <hi>The Crucified Jeſus Loving us to the Death;</hi> And by his Love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering our Hearts, and conſtraining us to be his, to love him, and live to him, and even dye for him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may obſerve, That our Lord has <hi>his Banquet, and Feast,</hi> whereunto he leads, and where he Entertains the Souls of his Followers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Diſplay of <hi>Chriſt's free, and glorious Love,</hi> is of all things the moſt proper to Invite, and Attract the Souls of Men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That Chriſt hath his Banquet, and Feaſt, unto which he leads, and where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains the Souls of his Followers.</hi> Under this <hi>Metaphor</hi> of a <hi>Feaſt,</hi> or <hi>Banquet;</hi> all
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:44317:132"/> the Spiritual Bleſſings of the Goſpel-State are often Repreſented.</p>
            <p>Thus when we Read of the Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>to come to the Marriage Feaſt of the Kings Son,</hi> Mat. 22. All the Graces and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Spirit are meant; <hi>forgiveneſs of Sin, the Promiſe,</hi> &amp; <hi>the hope of Eternal Life:</hi> Theſe are the Proviſions of this <hi>Feast,</hi> which in the <hi>Word and Sacraments</hi> we partake of. <hi>In this Mountain ſhall the Lord of Hoſts make unto all people a Feaſt of fat things, of Wine on the Lees well refined,</hi> Iſa. 25.6. It is a Promiſe concerning the Days of the Goſpel. <hi>In this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, In Mount Sion, In the Church,</hi> God will make a <hi>Feast for all people,</hi> for <hi>the Gentiles,</hi> as well as <hi>the Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It's Literally true of <hi>Mount Sion</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (in which ſenſe it muſt be underſtood in the next <hi>Verſe,</hi>) This was the firſt Place; this <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> whence the <hi>Chriſtian Law</hi> was to be given out, and <hi>the Word of the Lord from Jeruſalem.</hi> There the <hi>Holy Spirit fell upon the Apoſtles at Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt:</hi> And there the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> began their Preaching after the Deſcent of <hi>the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> with Wonderful Succeſs. So Pſalm 36.8. <hi>They ſhall be abundantly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the Fatneſs of thy Houſe; Thou ſhalt make them drink of the Rivers of thy Pleaſures.</hi> The like in <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.2. Where
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:44317:133"/> 
               <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>killed her Beaſts, and mingled her Wine, and furniſhed her Table.</hi> The <hi>Revelation of the Goſpel, &amp;c.</hi> All kind of <hi>Gifts, and Graces, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,</hi> diſtributed by the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the Goſpel, are to be underſtood. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that part of our Spiritual Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is ſaid to be <hi>Meat indeed, and Drink indeed:</hi> I mean the Crucified Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his Blood ſhed for the Remiſſion of Sins. That Inſtitution therefore hath the very Name of <hi>the Table of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.21. <hi>We cannot be Partakers of the Lord's Table, and the Table of Devils.</hi> It is called a <hi>Feaſt on the Sacrifice of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.7, 8. Of which I ſhall have occaiſon to ſpeak afterward. There being all Things <hi>there</hi> that are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a <hi>Feaſt;</hi> And <hi>a Feaſt for all People</hi> for the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whom the <hi>Jews</hi> deſpi-, ſed, and counted as Doggs, and who were Vile and Miſerable in themſelves, without God, and Chriſt, and under groſs <hi>Idolatry.</hi> This Feaſt is for us <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Which I ſhall firſt particularly <hi>Explain,</hi> and <hi>Prove,</hi> and then <hi>Apply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:44317:133"/>1. In this Spiritual <hi>Feaſt,</hi> or <hi>Banquet,</hi> are the Choiceſt Proviſions that can be, for the Nouriſhment of our Souls. There is Spiritual Food for the ſatisfaction of Spiritual Hunger where we may eat and be ſatisfied, and find that which is ſweeter than <hi>Honey, the Love of Chriſt bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Wine,</hi> Pſal. 22.6. Cant. 1.2. <hi>Wine,</hi> that is ſaid to <hi>chear, and delight the heart,</hi> Eccleſ. 10.19. To lift a Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſad, and melancholy Thoughts, Make a Man forget his Affliction, and Miſery, Prov. 31.7. <hi>Give Wine to him that is of a heavy heart, Let him drink and forget his poverty, and remember his miſery no more.</hi> It may much more be ſaid ſo of this Sacramental Wine, exhibiting the Love of Chriſt to the Soul. And though <hi>Wine</hi> be put for all manner of <hi>Delicacies,</hi> Iſa. 25.6. Yet <hi>the Love of Chriſt is better than Wine,</hi> Cant. 1.4 <hi>His Blood is Drink indeed, and his Fleſh is Meat indeed,</hi> John 6.55. Far beyond <hi>Manna,</hi> which yet is called <hi>Angels Food.</hi> He is <hi>Manna</hi> for <hi>Food,</hi> the beſt <hi>Bread;</hi> And He is <hi>Wine</hi> for <hi>Drink.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Bleſſedneſs of <hi>the Heavenly State,</hi> whereof this Feaſt is the Earneſt, is ſet forth by the Pleaſures of eating
<pb facs="tcp:44317:134"/> and drinking, Luk. 22 30. <hi>That you eat and drink at my Table in my Kingdom.</hi> O the Satisfaction and Delight that holy Souls experience, in taſting of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, when they come with that due Preparedneſs which they ought! All the Delights of this World are not to be compared with one hours Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt in this Ordinance: One hour, one half hour of Communion with the Father, and the Son, by the Spirit, in ſuch a Duty, is more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, than all the Pleaſures of the Palate and Taſte; It is a nobler, a purer, a ſweeter, a better kind of Content and Satisfaction, that we here meet with. I may appeal to the Experience of Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſtians, for the Truth of this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. At a Feaſt there are <hi>All Sorts of Proviſion;</hi> Not only the Choiceſt and the Beſt, but there is <hi>Variety.</hi> It i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>a Feaſt of Fat things full of Marrow,</hi> of <hi>Wine on the Lees well refined.</hi> And it is ſuitable to every Condition, to every Relation, to every Neceſſity. <hi>Grace for Grace, out of his Fulneſs,</hi> that is, All manner of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Grace, John 1.16. Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sin, to take away our Fear of Hell; And the Aſſurance of Eternal Life, to anſwer our Deſires of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:44317:134"/> And therefore anſwerable to all the Exigencies of our Caſe. For what can we need but may be received from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who of God is made unto us <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption?</hi> His precious Blood can waſh away the ſtains of our blackeſt guilt; and his perfect Righteouſneſs be the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of our Naked Souls; by Merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and procuring our Pardon, by Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing and applying the Spirit of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Light, Strength, Stability, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Whatever we need we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him, among the Proviſions of the Goſpel, in this Spiritual Feaſt.</p>
            <p>We may apply to the <hi>Heavenly Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of this Table,</hi> what the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay of their <hi>Manna in the Wilderneſs;</hi> It was ſent down by God from Heaven to them; It contained, they tell us, all the Taſtes that any Man deſired or longed for; It was ſuited to every Palate, and to every Conſtitution; That none could fail of being<note n="*" place="bottom">Bp. <hi>Patricks</hi> Chriſtian Sacrifice.</note> fed and pleaſed, though they were of never ſo different Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. It is called <hi>the bread of Heaven,</hi>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:44317:135"/> Exod. 16.4. And <hi>the Taſte of it</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>like Wafers made of Honey,</hi> Verſe 31. And yet in <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.8. the Taſte of it is ſaid to be <hi>as the Taſte of freſh Oile.</hi> Now, How can all theſe be true? How can they all Agree? that this <hi>Manna</hi> ſhould be like <hi>Bread,</hi> and like <hi>Honey,</hi> and like <hi>Oile</hi> too? The <hi>Jews</hi> Anſwer, That the <hi>Young Men</hi> taſted in it <hi>Bread,</hi> the <hi>Old Men Honey,</hi> and the <hi>Infants Oile.</hi> We may Accommodate this to the Divine Food of the Lord's Table, which is ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to every Complexion of Mind, and Temper of Spirit. The Infant Chriſtians are there cheriſhed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, they having the Oile of Joy and Gladneſs poured upon them: The Young Men have Strength and Power by this Bread of Life, to overcome the Wicked One: The more Aged, the more Exerciſed Chriſtians, they find ſuch Reliſh in it, that they can ſay, <hi>Thy Commandments are ſweeter than the Honey, and the Honey-comb, and in keeping of them there is great Reward;</hi> Being a little Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and Pledge, and Foretaſte of the Joys of the Heavenly Feaſt. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Manna in the Wilderneſs</hi> had the Taſte of Honey, ſay the <hi>Jews,</hi> that it might be an Earneſt and Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>the Land of Canaan,</hi> a <hi>Land flowing
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:44317:135" rendition="simple:additions"/> with milk and honey,</hi> unto which they were now going. In a word, Young and Old, Weak and Strong, Chriſtians of all Sizes, and different Stations, may receive Nouriſhment, Refreſhment, and Advantage by this Heavenly Food of the Table of the Lord. There is <hi>great variety</hi> at this Feaſt, to ſuit every ones Palate and Temper.</p>
            <p n="3">3. At a Feaſt, as there is <hi>Rarity,</hi> and <hi>Variety,</hi> ſo <hi>Plenty</hi> and <hi>Abundance,</hi> that none need go away hungry or empty, complaining or diſcontented. Here are Riches, unſearchable Riches of the Grace of Chriſt. We have here <hi>All things</hi> given us, <hi>richly to enjoy.</hi> And the Sanctifying Gifts and Graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are ſaid to be ſhed on us <hi>richly,</hi> or <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly,</hi> through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Tit</hi> 3, 6. There is a Fountain of Grace that will not have the leſs for us, by ſupplying the wants of others.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is a <hi>Mirth,</hi> and <hi>Chearfulneſs</hi> at this Feaſt, which is another Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant of <hi>a Banquet. A Feaſt is made for Laughter, and Wine maketh Merry,</hi> Eccleſ. 10.19. When prodigal Sinners firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, their Father hath Mirth, and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick to entertain them. Luk. 15.24.
<pb facs="tcp:44317:136"/> 
               <hi>Let us kill the fatted Calfe, and make merry; For this my Son was loſt, and is found; was dead, but is alive.</hi> And ſhall not the Reconciliation between God and our Souls through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when it is ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſed, and avowed at the Table of the Lord, be accompanied with <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Mirth?</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> were not to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict their Souls in any of their Feaſts, <hi>Religious</hi> or <hi>Common. Thou ſhalt Rejoyce in thy Feaſts,</hi> Deut. 16.14. We are not called to <hi>the Houſe of Mourning.</hi> You may eat this Bread with Joy, and drink this Wine with a Merry Heart, in hopes of God's Acceptance of you, and your <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.7.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Redeemer</hi> ſeems to ſpeak to thoſe who are Diſconſolate at his Table, and if he ſee us Sad and Melancholy, to uſe ſome ſuch Language,</p>
            <p>

            <p n="5">5.

               <hi>Come</hi> therefore, ſays <hi>Christ, Take</hi> and <hi>Eat;
<pb facs="tcp:44317:138"/> Eat, O Friends, drink abundantly, O Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> Take, eat this Morſel; as little and inconſiderable as it ſeems to be, it coſt my Life: I give it to you as a Token of my Love, and of my Fathers Love.

I ſay the ſame for <hi>the Cup of Bleſſing,</hi> Drink it in Remembrance of me; Come pledge me, This is Wine of my own making, when I trod the <hi>Wine-preſs</hi> of my Father's Wrath <hi>alone.</hi> This will ſtrengthen and revive thy fainting Spirit; This will cure the Ulcers of thy Heart, This will give thee Boldneſs, and Courage to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Preſence of thy Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus does <hi>Chriſt</hi> give <hi>Welcome</hi> to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Gueſts.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And <hi>Lastly.</hi> This is a peculiar ſort of Feaſt, viz. <hi>a Feaſt upon a Sacrifice;</hi> A Feaſt that betokens a Covenant, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation between God and ſuch as are Invited Gueſts at this Table. I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten take occaſion to mention this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I judge it <hi>the true Notion of the Lord's Supper,</hi> and the ſenſe of the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 5.8. <hi>Chriſt our Paſſover was Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for us, Let us therefore keep the Feaſt, with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleavened Bread of Sincerity and Truth,</hi> which is ſpoken of the <hi>Feaſt,</hi> from which the <hi>Corinthian Church,</hi> by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Christ,</hi> was to bar and ſeclude the diſorderly Perſon.</p>
            <pb n="260" facs="tcp:44317:139"/>
            <p>It is well known, that <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were wont to be attended with <hi>a Feaſt.</hi> The <hi>Peace-offering</hi> under the Law was to be brought on the top of <hi>the Burnt-offerings;</hi> No <hi>burnt offerings</hi> were without ſome <hi>peace-offerings;</hi> And having offer'd them to the Lord, they were to eat their part chearfully among their Friends. For then they had, as it were, one Diſh ſent them from God's Table. One part of the Offering, viz. <hi>God's,</hi> was conſumed upon the Altar; Another part, <hi>the Prieſts had</hi> by God's Appointment; And a <hi>Third,</hi> the <hi>Offerers</hi> had to Feaſt upon. <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Offering up himſelf upon the Croſs, is <hi>the Great Sacrifice:</hi> This Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet at the Table of the Lord is <hi>a Feaſt on that Sacrifice,</hi> Pſal. 50.5. <hi>Gather my Saints together, who have made a Covenant with me by Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Offering a Sacrifice was <hi>a Foederal Rite,</hi> whereby God and his People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came one.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:44317:139"/> of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> a Symbol of <hi>Peace.</hi> And <hi>Feaſting</hi> on a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was a Rite of the ſame Nature with Sacrificing; It being but the <hi>Complement,</hi> the <hi>Cloſe,</hi> the <hi>Finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the Sacrifice. In this ſenſe ſome underſtand thoſe words, Pſal. 50.16. <hi>

Thus when the Covenant was renewed between God and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael; Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the <hi>Seventy Nobles</hi> of the <hi>Children of Iſrael</hi> went up to God, and ſaw his Glory on the <hi>Mount,</hi> and after their <hi>burnt-offerings</hi> and <hi>peace-offerings</hi> are Sacrificed, they did <hi>eat and drink,</hi> Exod. 24.11. The eating of the <hi>Paſſover</hi> was ſuch a <hi>Foederal Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and therefore <hi>no Stranger</hi> was to <hi>eat of it,</hi> Exod. 12. It did not belong to thoſe who did not belong to that <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> which God had made with his Peculiar People the <hi>Children of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Evangelical Feaſt at the Lord's Table is of the like nature and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Beſides, the Analogy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance between theſe, the words of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:44317:140"/> Inſtitution do ſufficiently prove it; for ſpeaking of the <hi>Cup,</hi> or the <hi>Wine in the Cup,</hi> Our Lord ſaid, <hi>This is my blood of the New Covenant.</hi> It is the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Blood, which is the Seal of the <hi>New Covenant:</hi> As <hi>Circumciſion is</hi> called <hi>the Covenant of Circumciſion,</hi> Acts 7.8. becauſe it was the Token and Seal of the Covenant between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eating and Drinking together was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way reckon'd ſome token of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Accord; Eſpecially when there is <hi>a Solemn Feaſt</hi> on purpoſe to expreſs, and ſignifie this Agreement; And when it follows after Diſagreement and Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it amounts to a <hi>covenant,</hi> or <hi>league,</hi> which the Parties enter into to be hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward Friends. As <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.28, 29, 30, 31. Verſes. <hi>Let us make a covenant with thee,</hi> &amp;c. And then it follows, <hi>He made them a feaſt, and they did eat and drink.</hi> But in the preſent caſe, there is yet more, for it was a more ſacred way of <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting,</hi> when they Feaſted upon <hi>part of the Sacrifice,</hi> that was made to God, of which I ſhall ſpeak more preſently. And uſually it was accompanied with <hi>an Oath,</hi> in the preſence of God.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Now at the Lords Table, Do we not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our owning the New Covenant, made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us? And do we not there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our</hi> Baptiſmal Covenant? <hi>Do we not accept of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and all the</hi> Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Do we not receive the Pledge, and Aſſurance of his Love to us, and Engage our</hi> Faith <hi>that we will be his Servants; Binding our ſelves to all</hi> the Duties <hi>of the</hi> Covenant, <hi>as God does oblige himſelf to beſtow all</hi> the Bleſſings <hi>of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Having thus explained ſomewhat of this Banquet, or Feaſt, I might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Reaſons of its Appointment, and the excellent purpoſes it ſerveth for; Beſides the known, expreſs, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal one, of being <hi>a Memorial of Christ's Love,</hi> that we may remember him Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified for us; there may be other Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, partly with reſpect to God and Chriſt, partly with relation to the Souls of Believers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To repreſent <hi>the Royalty,</hi> and <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence</hi> of God, and the Tranſcendant Riches and Glory of the Grace of Chriſt. Accordingly we Read, that Princes and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:44317:141" rendition="simple:additions"/> Potentates, and Great Men, upon ſuch Accounts, were wont to make Sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Entertainments, Eſth. 1.3, 4. <hi>He made a Feaſt unto all his Princes, and his Servants, to ſhew them the Riches of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Kingdom, and the Honour of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Partly with reſpect to us. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To encourage us in the difficult Services we may meet with. To animate and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden us to hold on our way, and work, of doing and ſuffering the Will of God, in obedience to Chriſt. The burthen of Affliction would be much more heavy, and our Spirits more like to faint, were it not for ſome Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Quickening, and Comfort, now and then in ſuch Ordinances of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: But the Pledge of the Love of God, and the everlaſting Love of Chriſt, the Earneſt of Heaven, and the Hopes of it, that we ſhould Sin, and Suffer, and Sorrow no more, makes outward Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons tolerable: For if God be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to us, and pleaſed with us; If the Redeemer ſhine upon us, and ſay <hi>he is ours;</hi> If <hi>his Love</hi> be ſhed abroad in our Hearts, and <hi>ours</hi> kept alive to him; we can bear any thing, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:44317:141"/> Dedication of our ſelves, and all we have unto Chriſt, which we there make, helps to awe our Hearts, and check our impatient murmurs; when by any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Diſpenſation of Providence he doth but take us at our word. For he can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Take that, which we Reſigned to him before; and when he doth, he tries whether we were Hypocrites, or Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in our Reſignation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may be conſider'd, That at this Feaſt we have the <hi>neareſt Fellowſhip,</hi> and <hi>ſweeteſt Communion</hi> with God, and Chriſt, of almoſt any Ordinance of the Goſpel; And the continuance of ſuch a bleſſed Entercourſe between God and our Souls, was another ground of his appointing it. Which will appear more plainly, by conſidering Another end of it, <hi>viz.</hi> to ratifie and confirm <hi>the Covenant</hi> between God and us. This is one ſpecial deſign of thus eating and drinking <hi>in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> to confirm our <hi>Covenant.</hi> It was very uſual, eſpecially in the Eaſtern parts of the World, to ratifie Contracts and Covenants, by eating and drinking together. Thus in the fore-mentioned Inſtance, <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> celebrated ſuch a Covenant-Feaſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.30. as a Token of Friendſhip between them.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:44317:142"/> 
               <hi>Laban's</hi> eating with <hi>Jacob on an heap of Stones,</hi> was a Foederal Rite, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.46. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> eating of the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> Victuals, was the contracting a League with them, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9.14. When <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of his <hi>Friends Treachery</hi> (in words very applicable to <hi>Judas) Pſal.</hi> 41.9. he ſaith, <hi>My own Familiar Friend, in whom I truſted, who did eat of my Bread, hath lift up his Heel againſt me:</hi> He meant one who had entred into Covenant with him by a Feaſt (as you find that <hi>Abner</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.20.) Therefore, in ſtead of a <hi>Friend,</hi> 'tis otherwiſe rendred in the <hi>Margin</hi> of our <hi>Bibles, The Man of my Peace,</hi> or the Man that was <hi>at Peace</hi> with me. Hence the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>a Covenant,</hi> is derived from a <hi>Root,</hi> which ſignifies to <hi>Eat.</hi> And hence too we read of an Idol among the <hi>Siche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> which was called <hi>Berith</hi> (or the God of a <hi>Covenant</hi>) becauſe the People of that Place were wont, when they made Covenants, to eat and drink with their Confederates in the Houſe of that God of theirs, as you find they did, when they entred into a League with <hi>Gaal,</hi> and made him their Head in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to <hi>Abimeleck,</hi> Judg. 9.27.</p>
            <pb n="267" facs="tcp:44317:142"/>
            <p>Humane Writers afford many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this Nature, how People were wont antiently to make and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>Covenants</hi> between <hi>Nation</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> between <hi>Party</hi> and <hi>Party,</hi> and between <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> ſometimes by eating <hi>Bread,</hi> ſometimes by drinking <hi>Wine,</hi> and frequently by partaking of <hi>both</hi> together. Which ſhows, that it was the General Cuſtom of <hi>Mankind</hi> to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> with one another by the <hi>Viſible Rites</hi> of <hi>Feaſting,</hi> and <hi>Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> together. The <hi>Old Heathens</hi> had many <hi>Religious Feaſts</hi> before their <hi>Idols,</hi> whereby they <hi>Covenanted</hi> with thoſe <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Deities.</hi> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are charged with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> for complying with ſuch <hi>Pagan Rites,</hi> Exod. 32.6. 1 Cor. 10.7. When the <hi>People</hi> made an <hi>Altar</hi> to the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> they bring their <hi>Peace-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and Celebrate a <hi>Religious Banquet</hi> upon the remainders thereof. <hi>They ſat down to eat and to drink,</hi> (to <hi>Feast</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the <hi>Golden Calf,) and roſe up to play.</hi> This they did in Imitation of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> among whom they had lived ſo long.

            <p>And the Apoſtle calls the eating of the Heathen Sacrifices, <hi>a Fellowſhip with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.20. There were ſome in the Apoſtles time did go and eat of thoſe <hi>Idol Sacrifices,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.7. To prevent which a Canon was made at the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould <hi>abstain from Meats offered unto Idols,</hi> Acts 15. Becauſe by ſitting at Meat at the Idols Temple, they made themſelves <hi>partakers of the Table of Devils.</hi> And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhews the Inconſiſtency of this with the participation of the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe this is a Sacrifical <hi>Banquet,</hi> proper and peculiar to us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as the <hi>Idol-Feaſts,</hi> were <hi>Sacrifical Banquets</hi> proper to the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and the <hi>Moſaical</hi> ones to the <hi>Jews,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. As <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> were wont to feed upon a <hi>Sacrificed Beaſt,</hi> we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do feed upon a <hi>Sacrificed Redeemer,</hi> by eating and drinking in Commemoration of his

            <p n="4">4. Another Deſign of this Feaſt may be, to wean us from the Vanities of this World, by taſting theſe Spiritual Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and therein <hi>how gracious the Lord is:</hi> That by eating of this Bread, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Wine, we may hunger and thirſt no more after Senſual Delights, That we may not care to feed on Husks, when we eat of this Bread in our Fathers Houſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That our Thoughts of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Glory, and our Deſires after it, and progreſſive Meetneſs for it, may be excited and promoted. And no Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Goſpel is ſo proper for this, ſo well Adapted for this purpoſe, as were eaſie to ſhew, and your own Meditations can ſufficiently enlarge.</p>

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:44317:144"/> That we ſhould be called to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Children, to ſit down at his Table; We that deſerve not the Crumbs with the Dogs under the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: That he doth not only richly Feaſt us, but ſtoops to Treat us in our own way, in a manner ſo ſenſible, and eaſie, and plain; that we may ſee, and taſte, to our fuller ſatisfaction, that he is Gracious: That the outward Signs and Symbols are ſo plain, and obvious, when the great Things ſignified, and repreſented, are fit to employ the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Meditation, and ſurpaſs all that our moſt comprehenſive Thoughts can reach.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Doth God make ſuch a <hi>Feaſt?</hi> Then let him never Invite, but be you willing and ready to come; Take heed how you ſlight the Invitation, and Call of God. It is a dangerous thing, I grant, to come <hi>unprepared,</hi> and <hi>unready;</hi> and ſo is it to tarry away, and to refuſe Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Command of our dying Lord, who <hi>the ſame Night in which he was betrayed,</hi> Inſtituted this Feaſt, and calls us to do it <hi>in Remembrance of him.</hi> They that come without <hi>a Wedding Garment,</hi> they are ſaid to be <hi>

You little mend the caſe, if, when you hear of the <hi>Danger of coming unworthily,</hi> you will not <hi>come at all:</hi> For that Impenitence, and Unbelief that makes <hi>unworthy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,</hi> will not excuſe your Neglect of the Duty; You muſt Repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, and ſo come <hi>prepared. He that eateth this Bread, and drinketh this Cup unworthily, he eats and drinks Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to himſelf:</hi> 'Tis certain he is guilty of a <hi>Sin,</hi> that <hi>without Repentance,</hi> will <hi>damn him;</hi> and he is in danger of ſome Calamity, Sickneſs, or ſudden Death: Such as was inflicted on the <hi>faulty Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians:</hi> But he doth not ſo <hi>eat and drink Damnation,</hi> as that ſuch a Sin is <hi>

If the fear of <hi>Damnation</hi> have influence in the one Caſe, it ſhould have in the other: becauſe to neglect this Duty, is a <hi>Sin,</hi> as well as <hi>to come unprepared;</hi> we ought to do neither.</p>
            <p>You therefore who are <hi>to come,</hi> look to it that you <hi>come worthily,</hi> leſt you be Guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord; Leſt you be Guilty of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

            </p>
            <p>You will hereupon, I doubt not be glad of a little Advice, and Direction, that you may <hi>come worthily,</hi> and be <hi>duly prepared,</hi> that you may avoid ſo great a hazard.

            <p>A Strange and ſurprizing Spectacle, to ſee an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of our Lord carry it like an <hi>Infidel,</hi> an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer;</hi> To behold one of the <hi>Twelve,</hi> that was to ſpread the <hi>Faith of Chriſt</hi> throughout the Univerſe, to want that Faith, which he was to perſwade others to. To hear the great Article of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> one of the moſt deeply Fundamental Articles of the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:44317:150"/> to be obſtinately denied by thoſe Lips, that were to Publiſh the Goſpel of Chriſt: And this as the Sum of it, <hi>That he is Riſen from the dead.</hi> What more likely to ſcandalize the Weak, to ſtagger the Faith of many, not yet confirmed Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and to hinder the belief of Chriſt's being Riſen, than ſuch an Example of Incredulity in one of his <hi>Apoſtles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the permiſſion of ſuch Falls, and the raiſing a Revenue of Glory to the Redeemer by them, is one of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> that will be <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Adored.</hi> This is ſufficiently manifeſt in this very Paſſage, relating to the Apoſtle <hi>Thomas;</hi> whoſe <hi>Infidelity,</hi> as one of the <hi>Ancients</hi> obſerves, has proved as ſerviceable to Chriſtianity, as the <hi>Faith</hi> of the other Apoſtles.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:44317:150"/> Teſtimony had been more liable to ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God has Recorded the <hi>Faults,</hi> and <hi>Miſcarriages</hi> of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, for our <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>

            <p>Let us therefore view this Paſſage, and conſider what <hi>Reflections</hi> may be made upon it: And the whole may be comprehended under theſe <hi>Four</hi> Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Incredulity of this Apoſtle,</hi> he could not believe, without ſeeing, &amp; feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and having the Teſtimony of Senſe. <hi>Except I ſhall ſee in his Hands the print of the Nails, and put my Finger into the print of the Nails, and thruſt my Hand into his
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:44317:151"/> Side, I will not believe,</hi> Verſe 25.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Condeſcention and Kindneſs of Chriſt, in appearing to him another time, and granting it,</hi> Verſe 26, 27.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Cure of his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Confeſſion of Faith, which thereupon he makes,</hi> Verſe 28. <hi>And</hi> Thomas <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid unto him, My Lord, and my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The uſeful Admonition which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gives us concerning</hi> Faith, that though Thomas <hi>having ſeen him, had believed, yet Rather bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and yet have believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning <hi>the Incredulity</hi> of this <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> gives us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that on the <hi>Firſt Day of the Week,</hi> towards <hi>Evening,</hi> our Lord being Riſen from the Dead, early in the <hi>Morning,</hi> when the Diſciples were met together, and had ſhut the Door for fear of the <hi>Jews, Ver.</hi> 19. He ſuddenly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents himſelf amongſt them, ſaying, <hi>Peace be unto you.</hi> He aſſures them of his being Riſen from the Dead, imparts to them the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and gives them a Charge and Commſſion, to <hi>act</hi> as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:44317:151"/> in Remitting, or Retaining <hi>Sins.</hi> But <hi>Thomas,</hi> whoſe <hi>Greek Name</hi> was <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dymus,</hi> both ſignifying <hi>Twins,</hi> was not preſent at this Aſſembly: But as ſoon as the other Diſciples met him, they tell him, <hi>They had ſeen the Lord,</hi> that <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> had ſeen him, that <hi>Peter</hi> had ſeen him, and <hi>the two Diſciples going to</hi> Emaus, and then <hi>all the Ten,</hi> and had full Aſſurance that he was <hi>Riſen.</hi> This makes little Impreſſion in order to his believing it; for no Eyes will ſerve him but his own. Though <hi>Faith</hi> comes by <hi>hearing,</hi> he profeſſes he would <hi>not believe,</hi> except he ſaw; <hi>Except I ſee in his hands the print of the Nails, and put my Finger into the prints of the Nails, and thruſt my Hand into his Side, I will not believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O ſuſpicious incredulous <hi>Man!</hi> Who will be the Loſer, if thou wilt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? But wherefore doſt thou doubt? How is it that ſo many <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Tongues</hi> are not as credible, as thine own <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Hands?</hi> Shall the World be Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyted to the Faith of Chriſt, upon the Teſtimony of theſe Witneſſes, and wilt not thou Aſſent? Did not thy Lord foretel his own Death, and Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Didſt thou not hear him declare, that he muſt be Crucified, and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:44317:152"/> on the <hi>Third Day he would Riſe again?</hi> Is there any thing we Atteſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Reſurrection, but what was promiſed, and foretold? Why may not we be credited in our Report of a Matter of Fact, whereof we have ſo plain and full an Evidence? What ground is there to disbelieve ſo many Eye-witneſſes: If there had been none but <hi>the Women,</hi> who ſaw him, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themſelves ſeen him, their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony in that caſe might have been credited: But here are <hi>Ten Diſciples</hi> that ſay, <hi>We have ſeen the Lord.</hi> Had they been <hi>Ten Strangers,</hi> there were little reaſon to Reject the Teſtimony of <hi>Ten Perſons,</hi> to one Point which they had the Teſtimony of Senſe to aſſure them of: But here are <hi>Ten of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> of whoſe Capacity, and Probity, and Faithfulneſs, thou canſt not doubt: And they all agree in this Teſtim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>In this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonable Diſtruſt,</hi> and <hi>Sullen <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> he continues for a whole week; obſtinately profeſſing, <hi>That, without ſuch an unreaſonable Condeſcenſion of Chriſt, to convince his very Senſes, that he will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his being Riſen.</hi> It is ſtrange, that one of the <hi>Twelve,</hi> an <hi>Apostle</hi> of our Lord, after Three Years Converſation in his Family, ſhould be ſo <hi>Incredulous,</hi> as to believe nothing but what he ſaw; and that he ſhould refuſe to believe on ſuch ample Teſtimony; eſpecially when it was an <hi>Article</hi> that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob, Job,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> believed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Meſſiah,</hi> whom they never ſaw.</p>
            <p>It is the more ſurprizing too <hi>in this Apoſtle,</hi> becauſe he had not only been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently called by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with him, been brought up in his Company, and was one of his Houſe; but on a former Occaſion, this <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had declared more zeal than the Reſt of them; when they Heſitated concerning the Propoſal <hi>Christ</hi> made, of his going into <hi>Judea</hi> to raiſe <hi>Lazarus,</hi> upon the account of the hatred of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt him, <hi>John</hi> 11.16. <hi>Then ſaid Thomas to the other Diſciples, Let us alſo go, that we may die with him.</hi> Tho
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:44317:153"/> ſome think he ſpake this with another Air, and in another Senſe, than is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly thought; as if he would ſay, <hi>Since we cannot perſwade him, let us even go and periſh, if it muſt be ſo; Periſh we muſt, and there's an end.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>This is further aggravated, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Import</hi> of <hi>this Article,</hi> which he refuſes to <hi>believe:</hi> Not only as that which was <hi>foretold</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> by the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> but as the <hi>Baſis,</hi> and <hi>Foundation of our Religion,</hi> as that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Glory of Chriſt</hi> is <hi>principally concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> as that which <hi>removes the Ignominy of his Croſs;</hi> And therefore <hi>the Jews,</hi> who <hi>ſet themſelves to oppoſe the Belief of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> were thereby, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, more <hi>Injurious to Chriſt,</hi> than by their <hi>Crucifixion</hi> of him: For they do what they can to <hi>deprive him</hi> of <hi>that new Life</hi> he had, when he was Riſen; and they <hi>kill him</hi> a <hi>Second Time.</hi> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aggravates the <hi>Fault</hi> of <hi>Thomas,</hi> that by his <hi>

            <p>Before I proceed to his <hi>Cure,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,</hi> let us conſider what <hi>Inſtructions</hi> may be learned from <hi>the Incredulity</hi> of this <hi>Apoſtle.</hi> As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Faith</hi> is no ſuch <hi>Eaſie Matter</hi> as ſome perſwade themſelves. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> is <hi>ſtrangely Rooted</hi> in the Hearts of <hi>Men,</hi> and very difficultly <hi>cured.

There needs no other <hi>Eve</hi> to tempt to the <hi>ſin of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> than the <hi>ſin of our own Fleſh,</hi> and any kind of <hi>Temptation</hi> is enough to draw us to it. The <hi>Devil</hi> does not tell <hi>Thomas,</hi> as he did our Firſt Parents, <hi>You ſhall be as God's, You ſhall not dye;</hi> But rather on the contrary, <hi>You ſhall be as Beaſts, You ſhall die,</hi> and <hi>never Riſe more:</hi> For if <hi>Chriſt</hi> be not Riſen, we in vain expect to Riſe; his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> being the <hi>cauſe,</hi> and <hi>pattern</hi> of <hi>ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="291" facs="tcp:44317:154"/>
            <p>Now under this Temptation, this <hi>Holy Apoſtle</hi> fell; and if he, who had <hi>true Love to Chriſt,</hi> and was a <hi>True Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> was yet ſo <hi>Incredulous;</hi> it is leſs ſtrange that the greateſt part of the World, as to <hi>Divine Things,</hi> are ſo Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing; when the <hi>Corruptions,</hi> and <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and <hi>evil Inclinations</hi> of Men, have ſuch a Power and Influence upon their <hi>Minds.</hi> There needs therefore the Exerciſe of a <hi>mighty power</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Faith in the Heart;</hi> And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we read of <hi>the exceeding greatneſs of that mighty Power, which raiſed Chriſt from the dead, imployed towards them that believe,</hi> Epheſ. 1.19, 20.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable, That nothing but <hi>the Preſence of Chriſt himſelf,</hi> could cure the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> of this <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> Till <hi>then,</hi> the Teſtimony of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and all that <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> could ſay, all the Diſcourſes of <hi>the other Apostles,</hi> had no effect. And ſo it is ſtill, that without the Preſence, and <hi>Power of Chriſt</hi> to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company <hi>the Miniſtry of the Word,</hi> they who are <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers</hi> will continue in their <hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In that <hi>his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> is attributed to <hi>his Abſence from the other Diſciples,</hi> when they <hi>Aſſembled</hi> together, We may learn to value <hi>the Aſſemblies of Christians,</hi> in hopes of the <hi>Preſence of Chriſt,</hi> and the Manifeſtation of himſelf.

            <p>Believe it, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> you cannot but be Loſers by your Abſence from <hi>the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies,</hi> eſpecially on <hi>the Lord's Day,</hi> as this was when the <hi>Diſciples</hi> met together, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> was with them: And if <hi>Thomas</hi> had not come amongſt them the next <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> he might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued longer in his <hi>Incredulity.</hi> He had

            <p>Therefore do not diſcontinue your Attendance on <hi>Publick Worſhip,</hi> when you have Opportunity. Do not ſay, We can Read as good a Sermon at home, or <hi>Pray</hi> as well at home.

               <hi>Thomas,</hi> and may expect to be aſſaulted, and ſtaggered by Temptations to Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and all other ſins, which only the <hi>Preſence</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Grace</hi> can cure: For where two or three are met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>in the Name of Chriſt,</hi> he has promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be <hi>with them.</hi> It is in <hi>the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of his People,</hi> that he manifeſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; it is <hi>there</hi> he makes known <hi>the Power of his Death,</hi> a d the <hi>Glory</hi> of his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection;</hi> it is <hi>there</hi> he diſpenſes the Gifts and Graces of his Spirit; And they that abſent themſelves out of Choice, they are voluntarily deprived of theſe Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe you ſhould ſpend your time on the Lord's Day at home, in <hi>Prayer, Reading,</hi> and <hi>Meditation,</hi> yet there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon to expect God ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you therein, while it ſignifies a Neglect, if not a Contempt of Publick Worſhip, which is more for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and is expreſly required, by the Inſtitution of ſuch Aſſemblies, and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Practice</hi> agreeable thereunto. You cannot reaſonably hope for ſuch Effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the <hi>Divine Grace</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> in a <hi>ſecret corner,</hi> as in the <hi>Congregation of the Faithful.</hi> There is <hi>room</hi> and <hi>time enough</hi> for <hi>Private Devotions,</hi> without the <hi>neglect of the Publick Worſhip.</hi> And God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

            <p n="3">3. I obſerve further, that what we have found of the Preſence and Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we may <hi>Communicate</hi> in order to the Conviction of Others, and the Aſſiſtance of their Faith. All the <hi>Diſciples</hi> endeavoured to perſwade <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Reſurrection,</hi> they <hi>All</hi> told him, <hi>We have ſeen the Lord;</hi> and no doubt they urged him, with all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of it, to convince him of the Unreaſonableneſs of his <hi>Obstinacy,</hi> who would not <hi>believe,</hi> except he could <hi>ſee. How unreaſonable was it,</hi> might they tell him, <hi>that Chriſt ſhould appear again upon his Account, merely to comply with his</hi> Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? <hi>And if he ſhould appear again, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely it was that</hi> he <hi>ſhould be priviledged more than</hi> they, <hi>who had only a bare</hi> ſight <hi>of him; Why ſhould he have more? Why ſhould he be permitted to thruſt his Hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Lord's Side, and his Fingers into the Print of the Nails?</hi> He might expect ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he would ſay to him, as to <hi>Mary, Touch me not, for I am not yet Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended:</hi>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:44317:157"/> And ſo, if he ſhould appear, and be ſeen of him, he might ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue <hi>an Infidel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This kind Office they did for him; thus doubtleſs did they endeavour to convince him, though without ſucceſs, they tell him, what they have ſeen. And they that have any ſight of <hi>Christ,</hi> or Experience of his Preſence, as they cannot but be willing to impart it to Others, ſo they may, and ought to do it, in order to their Conviction. Only let us take heed, that ſuch Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations be done with all poſſible <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That it is Unreaſonable, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking, to refuſe to Believe the Truth of any thing, merely becauſe we have not <hi>the Teſtimony of Senſe,</hi> to confirm it. This was the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Fault, <hi>I will not believe, except I ſee, and feel the Print of the Nails.</hi> This is to make <hi>Terms</hi> with the Bleſſed God, to <hi>limit the Holy One of Iſrael,</hi> and unreaſonably to Expect, that what is the Object of <hi>Faith,</hi> ſhould come under the View of <hi>Senſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. I may obſerve further, that <hi>Peter</hi> was one of theſe <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> that had ſeen
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:44317:158"/> the Lord; and yet <hi>Thomas</hi> does not hearken to <hi>Him</hi> neither, nor regard what <hi>he</hi> ſays, more than what the other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſaid. What little ground is there to think then, that <hi>he</hi> had any <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> above the reſt of <hi>the Apoſtles,</hi> and that he was <hi>the Prince</hi> of them? If he were ſo, Why did he not do his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? Why did he not ſhew his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? Here is a fair Occaſion for him to make uſe of the Authority of <hi>his Keyes,</hi> to ſtop the Mouth of <hi>this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,</hi> who ſays, he will <hi>not believe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he ſee.</hi> Why does not <hi>Peter</hi> define, and determine the matter, that was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, doubted, and denied by <hi>Thomas?</hi> There is nothing of all this, however proper the occaſion might have been.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In that <hi>this Incredulity</hi> of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> was <hi>over-ruled to ſo much good,</hi> for the further Confirmation of the <hi>Great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ's Reſurrection,</hi> let us ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire <hi>the Divine Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>the World;</hi> who, tho he cannot be the Author of <hi>Sin,</hi> does yet over-rule <hi>it,</hi> to his own Glory. He hath done ſo in many <hi>Eminent Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and he did ſo in <hi>this?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="299" facs="tcp:44317:158"/>
            <p>Hereby the Honour of <hi>Christ</hi> is the more advanced by his <hi>open Confeſſion</hi> of him afterwards, as <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>God:</hi> and the <hi>Truth</hi> of his <hi>being Riſen</hi> is the better confirmed, and ſo the <hi>Faith</hi> of others aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by his Fall. It was well for <hi>the Apoſtle,</hi> and it was well for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> that he did not believe preſently: He was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards brought to the moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Exerciſe, and Declaration of his <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not only of his being <hi>Riſen,</hi> but of his being <hi>the Eternal Son of God,</hi> and of his happy <hi>Intereſt in him,</hi> and <hi>Relation to him,</hi> as <hi>his Lord,</hi> and <hi>his God:</hi> And we have a greater Evidence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by of the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Reſurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doubtleſs this Fall of <hi>Thomas</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a <hi>Motive</hi> to his greater <hi>Diligence</hi> in the Service of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> for his <hi>Glory;</hi> as it was with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Let us not raſhly judge of Men by a ſingle Act. Thomas</hi> had true Faith, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this <hi>Fit of Doubting,</hi> and Unbelief; which revived upon the Sight, and Preſence of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> within a few Days. Many, that in a fit of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, we may think, have <hi>no Truth of Grace;</hi> yet if we ſtay a while, do ſoon
<pb facs="tcp:44317:159"/> diſcover it: Some ſpecial Ordinance, or Providence brings them to themſelves, and ſuddenly ſhows the Reality of that, which did not Appear, but the contrary Corruption.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Having thus conſidered <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> of this <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> let us now obſerve <hi>the Compaſſion, Condeſcenſion, and Kindneſs of Chriſt</hi> to this <hi>Incredulous Apoſtle.</hi> Eight days after, the <hi>Diſciples</hi> being together, and <hi>Thomas with them, Jeſus came and ſtood in the midſt of them, ſaying, Peace be with you;</hi> and ſays to <hi>Thomas,</hi> Verſ. 27. <hi>Reach hither thy Finger, and behold my Hands; and reach hither thy Hand, and thruſt it into my Side, and be not Faithleſs, but Believing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> if our Saviour had left him to his own Pertinacious Increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Whom could he have blamed but himſelf, if he had continued in his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief? But our Lord came and ſhewed him his Hands, and Feet, and bids him do what he deſired, for his Conviction. How mercifully doth he pity us, in our Errors, and Infirmities? With what Tenderneſs and Compaſſion doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim us? And this when he was <hi>Riſen from the Dead,</hi> after he was declared to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:44317:159"/> be the Son of God with Power, when he was to receive the Recompence, and Reward of his Death, and Sufferings; when his State of Humiliation was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And yet, How low does he ſtoop for the ſake of this <hi>Apostle?</hi> when ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable a thing too was demanded, as the Condition of his Believing? But ſuch is the Admirable <hi>Bounty</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he will not refuſe him, even <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Since you will not believe otherwiſe,</hi> O my Apoſtle, <hi>I conſent;</hi> Behold my Wounds, Behold the Print of the Nails; <hi>And if</hi> the Sight <hi>of them be not enough, to cure thine</hi> Infidelity, <hi>Come,</hi> Reach hither thine Hand, thruſt thy Finger into my Side; <hi>I care not what I do, or how low I ſtoop, rather than not convince, and heal thee: If the Evidence of</hi> one Senſe <hi>be not enough, I will yield further, and let thee have more.</hi>

               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:44317:160"/> in <hi>this Aſſembly,</hi> and ſpeaking to him ſuch Words, doth plainly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that <hi>he knew his Heart,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what Diſcourſe he had had, and what Objections he had made, and what was the Inward Senſe of his Soul; which he could not have done, without being <hi>Omniſcient.</hi> Little did this <hi>Apoſtle</hi> think, <hi>his Lord</hi> had heard him, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he <hi>knew his Sin.</hi> But, <hi>Come hither,</hi> ſays <hi>Chriſt, behold my Hands; Reach hither thy Hand, and thruſt it into my Side.</hi> He condeſcends to Grant <hi>that,</hi> which it was the <hi>Apoſtles Fault</hi> to <hi>Ask.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee, by theſe Words, our <hi>Riſen Lord</hi> retained the <hi>Marks</hi> of the <hi>Wounds,</hi> the <hi>Prints</hi> of the <hi>Nails,</hi> and <hi>Spear</hi> in his Body, after the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, with greater Certainty, the Truth of it.

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Kindneſs</hi> and <hi>Condeſcenſion</hi> of his Lord overcame him, and by theſe words
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:44317:161"/> he proves the Cure of his <hi>Infidelity.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he would <hi>not believe Chriſt to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live;</hi> now, he <hi>confeſſes him to be God.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reckoned him under the Power of <hi>Death,</hi> now he acknowledges him as the <hi>Lord,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Life.</hi> Before he believed <hi>leſs</hi> than any of <hi>the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> now he confeſſes <hi>more</hi> than <hi>All</hi> of them.</p>

               <hi>My Lord, my God.</hi> Thou art the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed of God, the King, the Head of the Church, the Expected, Promiſed Meſſiah.

            <p>Though he profeſſed his Unbelief in larger Words, <hi>Except I ſee the print of the Nails, and thruſt my Finger,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p n="2">2. Let us Conſider the Reality of his <hi>Faith,</hi> in this ſhort Confeſſion of it. For, upon theſe Words, <hi>My Lord, my God,</hi> our Saviour owns, in <hi>the next Verſe,</hi> the Truth of his Faith. <hi>Bleſſed art thou who haſt ſeen, and haſt believed:</hi> Though a more ample and abundant Bleſſing be pronounced on ſuch as did alſo believe, without that help of Sight and Senſe.</p>
            <p>But here is an Excellent Faith, and all the Eſſential parts of it, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this Expreſſion, <hi>My Lord, my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. An Aſſent to this Truth, that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the Chriſt,</hi> the true <hi>Meiſſah,</hi> who had Riſen again as he foretold.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:44317:163"/>2. An acknowledgment that <hi>this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is both Lord, and God:</hi> that abſolute Supremacy, Power, and Dominion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him, that he is <hi>true God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. An Appropriation of him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as <hi>his Lord,</hi> and <hi>his God;</hi> which following upon the former two, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of true <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. In this Expreſſion, we have an Evidence of the <hi>Two Natures of Chriſt;</hi> the Reality of his <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> and the Truth of his <hi>Divine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Reality of his Humane Nature.</hi> The Method our Lord uſes to prove his Reſurrection to this <hi>Apostle</hi> doth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he was <hi>true man,</hi> Partaker of Human Nature; that his Body was of ſuch a kind, that our Senſes might judge of it; for elſe he would not have bid <hi>Thomas</hi> behold him, and reach hither his Hand.</p>
            <p>This may eaſily be improved to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the <hi>Popiſh Fancy</hi> of <hi>Tranſubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that the Body and Blood of Chriſt are in the Lord's Supper, under the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of <hi>Bread and Wine.</hi> For at that rate <hi>Thomas</hi> might have ſtill objected,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:44317:163"/> That what he ſaw and touched was <hi>not the Body of Chriſt,</hi> but the Accidents of it, and that he was not obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the Teſtimony of his Senſes, <hi>that the Body of Chriſt was preſent.</hi> But his Obligation ſo <hi>to believe,</hi> is implyed in our Saviour's Words, <hi>Reach hither thy Hand, and be not faithleſs but believing.</hi> And on the ſame Teſtimony of Senſe, we are bound to believe, that <hi>it is Bread</hi> after Conſecration, and <hi>not Fleſh,</hi> that it is <hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>not Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The truth of <hi>his Godhead</hi> is alſo evident, that he is really, and <hi>truly God.</hi> This Title, <hi>My God,</hi> as well as <hi>My Lord,</hi> is very obſervable, becauſe it hath <hi>the Article</hi> before the Word, <hi>God.</hi> And it is commonly granted by the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Deity of Chriſt, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Word <hi>God</hi> is uſed with the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> before it, it there imports <hi>the True and Eternal God.</hi> So is the Expreſſion here, which our <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation</hi> does not reach; for it may rather be read, <hi>The Lord mine, the God mine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord, my God.</hi> From his Office, as <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he Riſeth to his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature,</hi> and <hi>the Dignity of his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi> He had reaſon to own him <hi>to be
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:44317:164"/> Chriſt the Lord,</hi> by his Reſurrection, and other things which he had obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and from that <hi>Dignity</hi> he owns him to be <hi>true God,</hi> worthy of <hi>the Higheſt Homage and Adoration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had it been otherwiſe, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> would not have given the Title <hi>of God,</hi> unto <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> nor would <hi>he</hi> have received it: For the Greater any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, the greater Danger there is of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him ſuch Titles as belong not to him. As to give to One that is next to <hi>the King,</hi> the Title <hi>of King.</hi> Eſpecially to aſcribe <hi>Divinity,</hi> and <hi>Godhead</hi> to a <hi>Creature.</hi> What can be more provoking to him, who is <hi>Jealous of his Honour, and will not give his Glory to another,</hi> Iſa. 42.</p>

            <p>Neither can it be imagined that our Saviour would have permitted ſuch a thing, without Rebuking him, if he had not been <hi>true God,</hi> as well as <hi>real Man.</hi> But ſo this <hi>Apoſtle</hi> does acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him, and ſo muſt we: And eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Manton, on</hi> Coloſ. 1.19. <hi>p.</hi> 202.</note> Office of Chriſt, as our <hi>Prophet, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> doth ſuppoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that he be <hi>true God,</hi> as well as <hi>true man,;</hi> or he could not diſcharge thoſe Offices to any Saving Purpoſe for us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let us then <hi>Imitate the Faith of this Apoſtle,</hi> in contemplating the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, that we alſo may ſay as he did, <hi>My Lord, and my God.</hi> And that will include both a Claim of Intereſt, and ſpecial Propriety in him, and imply the Dedication of our ſelves to his Uſe, and Service. The one of theſe will follow upon the other. When God ſays, <hi>I am thy God;</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:44317:165"/> but anſwer, <hi>That we are his Servants,</hi> and reſolve to be ſo: And if we are <hi>his,</hi> and Devoted to him, we may infer that he is <hi>Ours,</hi> for the Covenant is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
            <p>But if we cannot, as ſometimes we cannot, ſo clearly, and comfortably ſay, <hi>My God;</hi> We may yet humbly, and reſolvedly ſay, <hi>My Lord;</hi> that is, <hi>I am thy Servant, I am Devoted to thy Fear, I am reſigned and given up to thee; I have choſen thee for my Portion, and I have dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and devoted my ſelf for ever to be thine,</hi> &amp;c. The more ſerious we are in this, the more likely are we to come to this <hi>Claim,</hi> and <hi>Appropriation,</hi> and <hi>ſpecial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> in God, and Chriſt as <hi>ours:</hi> And till we Arrive to ſome Degree of this, we are Strangers to the moſt comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the <hi>Chriſtian Life:</hi> For this is a great ground of our Confidence, and a main Spring of our Joy. <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his. He loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> This attracts our Love, this wins our Hearts, and fills us with Joy unutterable, and <hi>full of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Chriſt, by the Preſence of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, would viſit our Souls; we ſhould then be able to uſe ſuch Language of

               <hi>Faith.</hi> If he will viſit us, as he did the <hi>Diſciples,</hi> when <hi>Thomas</hi> was with them; his Preſence and Power can produce ſuch a <hi>Faith;</hi> And if he pleaſe, he can enter and do this, though the Doors be barred, and ſhut never ſo cloſe. For he, can open them, as he did <hi>the Heart of Lydia.</hi> Though they be of Stone or Iron, he can break, he can ſoften, he can make them <hi>Hearts of Fleſh.</hi> Let us beg he would ſo viſit us, by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>Though we have not the Priviledge to <hi>touch him</hi> on Earth, as this <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> yet we may <hi>behold him,</hi> as the holy Martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi> in Heaven.

We have ſome of us ſo done this Day. And after ſuch a <hi>Sight,</hi> and <hi>ſuch a Taſte,</hi> ſhall we not cry out; <hi>My Lord, my God. O my Lord, what have I done? O my God, what ſhall I do?

            <p>This was Virtually done in <hi>our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> this was actually done at <hi>our firſt Turning to God,</hi> when we entred into <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to be the Lords;</hi> And this we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly <hi>Repeat,</hi> and publickly <hi>Renew,</hi> every time we come to <hi>this Table.</hi> We have this Day acknowledged him to be <hi>our Lord,</hi> we have entred into a <hi>ſolemn League</hi> of <hi>Subjection,</hi> and <hi>Fidelity</hi> to him; we have taken on us a <hi>ſolemn Bond,</hi> and <hi>Obligation of Duty,</hi> and <hi>Service;</hi> And if we are <hi>

For by Feaſting on <hi>this Sacrifice</hi> this Day, we have again <hi>Sworn at the Altar,</hi> we have ſaid it in our Hearts, My <hi>Lord, my God;</hi> And we have profeſſed it by our Actions. We have played the <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and acted the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:44317:167"/> part of <hi>Children,</hi> and <hi>Fools,</hi> if we did not mean it.
